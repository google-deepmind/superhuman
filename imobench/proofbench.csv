 Taking $x = 1$ for this one, we quickly obtain that $2(f(y+1) - f(y)) = f(2) - f(0) \Leftrightarrow f(y+1)-f(y) = (f(2)-f(0))/2$, so $f$ is linear, that is there exists $k,c$ such that $f(x) = kx+c$.

PB-Basic-004,"Find all strictly increasing functions $g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:
 (a) $g$ is surjective
 (b) $g(g(x))=g(x)+20x.$","Note that the function is bijective, so setting $x=0$ gives $g(0)=0$ and since it is strictly increasing, we further derive $g(x)>0$ for $x>0$ and $g(x)<0$ for $x<0$.

 Consider the sequence $u_0 = x, u_{n+1} = g(u_n)$, we have that $u_{n+1} = u_n + 20u_{n-1}$, which gives $u_n = a (-4)^n + b 5^n$ for some real number $a, b$. Moreover, since $g$ is a bijective, there exists a real number $r$ such that $u_{-1} = r$, and so the sequence is well-defined for negative integer $n$ by defining the sequence backward. And since the sequence is increasing, $u_0 > 0$ implies $u_n > 0$ for all integer $n$.

 We will show that $a = 0$, which implies $g(x) = u_1 = 5u_0 = 5x$.

 Indeed, assume that $a > 0$, if $u_0 = x > 0$ then we choose a sufficiently small odd negative integer $n$ such that $(-4/5)^n < -b/a$, this gives $u_n < 0$. However, since $g$ is increasing and $u_0 > 0$, we must have that $u_n > 0$, which is a contradiction. Similarly, if $u_0 = a+b < 0$ then we must have $b < 0$ given $a > 0$, and so for a sufficiently small negative even integer $n$, we have $(-4/5)^n > -b/a$, which gives $u_n > 0$, which is a contradiction. Thus, we must have $a \leq 0$.

 Similarly, we can show that $a < 0$ will lead to a contradiction, and so, we must have $a \geq 0$.

So it suffices to see the cases where $c_k \ne 0$ for all integers $k>0$. Let's prove the following lemma:
 If a polynomial $\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i$ has $n$ different real roots, $(\frac{a_{1}}{a_0})^2 - 2 \frac{a_{2}}{a_0} \geq n\sqrt[n]{\frac{a_n ^2}{a_0^2}}$

 Going back to the main proof, let's assume that all $P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^k c_i x^i$ has exactly $k$ distinct real roots.
 By the lemma, $\frac{c_{1}^2 - 2c_0 c_{2}}{\sqrt[n]{c_0^{2n-2}}} \geq n\sqrt[n]{c_n^2}$, which shows that $1\leq c_n^2 \leq (\frac{\frac{c_{1}^2 - 2c_0 c_{2}}{\sqrt[n]{c_0^{2n-2}}}}{n})^n$.

 We provide a solution when we relax the condition $a_n=3$. When we add back the condition, the only solution is $n=2$ with $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}\right)=(-1,1,3)$.

 When relaxing the condition $a_n=3$, the short answers are $n=1$ with $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\right)=(2,-2) ; n=2$ with $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}\right)=(-1,1,3)$; or $n$ even with $a_{0}=\cdots=a_{n}=-1$.

 It is clear that $a_{0} \neq 0$ as otherwise $a_{n}=0$. For any $k=1, \ldots, n+1$, let $I_{k}$ be the convex hull of $0, a_{0}, \ldots, a_{k-1}$. We will define $a_{-1}=0$ for convenience.

 We first show that $a_{k}$ is not in the interior of $I_{k}$. Otherwise, let $i, j \in\{-1,0, \ldots, k-$ $1\}$ be such that $a_{i}, a_{j}$ are the endpoints of $I_{k}$. Then as $a_{i}-a_{j} \mid f\left(a_{i}\right)-f\left(a_{j}\right)=$ $a_{i+1}-a_{j+1}$, we know that $a_{i+1}$ and $a_{j+1}$ are also the endpoints of $I_{k}$, and by continuing this argument we eventually get that $a_{k}$ is an endpoint of $I_{k}$, which is a contradiction. A consequence is that the endpoints of $I_{k}$ are $a_{k-2}$ and $a_{k-1}$ unless $a_{k-2}=a_{k-1}$. Now if $a_{i}=0$ for some $i>0$, then it is clear that the nonzero terms of $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}$ all have the same sign. Then $f\left(a_{i-1}\right)=0$ gives a contradiction if we take $i$ to be the smallest index with $a_{i}=0$.

 We first assume that $a_{n} \neq a_{0}$. If $\left|a_{i}\right|<2$ for any $i<n$, then we have several possibilities: either $n \leqslant 2$; or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}=-1,1, \ldots,-1,1$, or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}=1,-1, \ldots, 1,-1$, or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}=-1,1,1, \ldots, 1$, or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}=1,-1, \ldots,-1$, for $n>2$. It is easy to verify that the last four cases cannot occur by evaluating $f(1)$. Therefore we have $n=2, a_{0}=-a_{1} \in\{1,-1\}$, or $n=1, a_{0}= \pm 1$. In the first case, we have $a_{2}-a_{1}=f\left(a_{1}\right)-f\left(a_{0}\right)=2 a_{1}^{2}=2$ and so $a_{2}=a_{1}+2$. Therefore $a_{1}=f\left(a_{0}\right)=$ $\left(a_{0}+a_{1}+2\right)+a_{0} a_{1}=2-1=1$, and we get the solution $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}=-1,1,3$. In the second case, we have $a_{1}=f\left(a_{0}\right)= \pm a_{1} \pm 1$, and we get no solution by parity.

 Now if $a_{n} \neq a_{0}$ and $a_{n}$ has the largest absolute value, pick $i<n$ such that $\left|a_{i}\right| \geqslant 2$. Then

 \[
 \left|f\left(a_{i}\right)\right| \geqslant\left|a_{n}\right|\left(\left|a_{i}\right|^{n}-\left|a_{i}\right|^{n-1}-\cdots-1\right) \geqslant\left|a_{n}\right|,
 \]

 and $\left|f\left(a_{i}\right)\right|=\left|a_{i+1}\right|\left|a_{n}\right|$. Therefore all equalities should hold, and we get $a_{0}=\cdots=$ $a_{n-1}=-a_{n}$ and $\left|a_{i}\right|=2$. Note that if $n \geqslant 2$, then $a_{0}=a_{1}$, which shows that

 $a_{0}=\cdots=a_{n}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore $n=1$ and we get $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\right)=(2,-2)$ or $(-2,2)$. The latter is not a solution, so we get $a_{0}=2$ and $a_{1}=-2$.

 So now in the case that $a_{n} \neq a_{0}$, we may assume that $a_{n}$ does not have the largest absolute value. Let $a_{k}$ be the least index such that $a_{k}=a_{k+1}=\cdots=a_{n}$. Then we must have $\left|a_{k-1}\right|>\left|a_{k}\right|$ as $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k}$ are the endpoints of $I_{k-1}$. We know that $a_{0} \mid a_{k-1}$ and $a_{0} \mid a_{k}$, and so $\left|a_{k-1}\right| \geqslant\left|a_{k}\right|+\left|a_{0}\right|$. As $a_{k-1} \mid f\left(a_{k-1}\right)-f(0)=a_{k}-a_{0}$, we have $\left|a_{k-1}\right| \leqslant\left|a_{k}-a_{0}\right|$ since $a_{k} \neq a_{0}$. This shows that $\left|a_{k}-a_{0}\right|=\left|a_{k}\right|+\left|a_{0}\right|=\left|a_{k-1}\right|$. As a consequence, we have $\left|a_{i}\right| \leqslant\left|a_{k}\right|+\left|a_{0}\right|$ for any $i$. Now we have

 \[
 \left|a_{k}\right|=\left|f\left(a_{k-1}\right)\right| \geqslant\left|a_{k}\right|\left(\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n}-\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}-\cdots-1\right)-\left|a_{0}\right|\left(\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}+\cdots+1\right) .
 \]

 Hence

 \[
 \frac{\left|a_{k}\right|}{\left|a_{0}\right|} \leqslant \frac{\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}+\cdots+1}{\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n}-\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}-\cdots-1} .
 \]

 Note that $\left|a_{k}\right| /\left|a_{0}\right|$ is a positive integer. If it is greater than 1 , then as $\left|a_{k-1}\right|=$ $\left|a_{k}\right|+\left|a_{0}\right| \geqslant 3$, we have

 \[
 \frac{\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}+\cdots+1}{\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n}-\left|a_{k-1}\right|^{n-1}-\cdots-1} \leqslant \frac{3^{n-1}+\cdots+1}{3^{n}-3^{n-1}-\cdots-1}<1
 \]

 which is a contradiction. Therefore $\left|a_{k}\right|=\left|a_{0}\right|$, and so $a_{k}=-a_{0}$. This also shows that $a_{k-1}=2 a_{0}$, and by the inequality we see that $\left|a_{0}\right|=1$. With these constraints, we know that $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n} \in\left\{a_{0},-a_{0}, 2 a_{0}\right\}$. By enumerating, we only have the possibilities $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}= \pm 1, \pm 2, \mp 1, \pm 2, \mp 1, \ldots, \pm 2, \mp 1$, or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}= \pm 1, \mp 1, \pm 2, \mp 1, \ldots, \pm 2, \mp 1$, or $a_{0}, \ldots, a_{n}= \pm 1, \pm 2, \mp 1, \ldots, \mp 1$. For the first case, we have $n=2 t$ adn $2 a_{0}=a_{1}=$ $f\left(a_{0}\right)=-(t-1) a_{0}+2 t$, showing that $t=1, a_{0}=1$, and by plugging in $a_{1}$ we get a contradiction. For the second case, we have $n=2 t+1$ and $-a_{0}=a_{1}=f\left(a_{0}\right)=$ $(2 t+1) a_{0}-(t+1)$, which has no solutions. For the third case, if $a_{0}=1$ then we get $n=2$ and $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}=1,2,-1$ by the equation $a_{1}=f\left(a_{0}\right)$, which is not a solution. Thus $a_{0}=-1$, and by plugging in $a_{0}$ we also get a contradiction.

 The remaining case is $a_{n}=a_{0}$. If $a_{n}=a_{n-1}$, then we must have $a_{0}=\cdots=a_{n}$. By plugging in $a_{0}$ we have $a_{0}^{n+1}+\cdots+a_{0}^{2}=0$, and so $a_{0}=-1$ and $n$ is even. Now assume that $a_{n} \neq a_{n-1}$. Then $a_{n}, a_{n-1}$ are the endpoints of $I_{n+1}$. Note that if $a_{n-2}=a_{n-1}$

 then $a_{n}=a_{n-1}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore $a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}$ are also endpoints of $I_{n+1}$. By induction we may show that $a_{k}, a_{k-1}$ are the endpoints of $I_{k+1}$. As $a_{0} \neq 0$, we must have $a_{n}=a_{n-2}=\cdots=a_{0}$, and so $n$ is even. This shows that $a_{n-1}=\cdots=a_{1}$. Now we have

 \[
 a_{0}^{n+1}+a_{0}^{n-1} a_{1}+\cdots+a_{0}^{3}+a_{0} a_{1}+a_{0}=a_{1}
 \]

 and

 \[
 a_{0} a_{1}^{n}+a_{1}^{n}+\cdots+a_{0} a_{1}^{2}+a_{1}^{2}+a_{0}=a_{0}
 \]

 The latter can be rewritten as $\left(a_{0}+1\right)\left(a_{1}^{n-2}+a_{1}^{n-4}+\cdots+1\right)=0$. Therefore $a_{0}=-1$ or $a_{1}=-1$. If $a_{0}=-1$, then $-\left(a_{1}+1\right) n / 2-1=a_{1}$, or equivalently, $\left(a_{1}+1\right)(n+2)=0$. This shows that $a_{1}=-1$, which was already obtained above. If $a_{1}=-1$, then the first equation gives $a_{0}^{n+1}=-1$ and so $a_{0}=-1$ too.

 In conclusion, all the solutions are: $n=1$ with $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}\right)=(2,-2) ; n=2$ with $\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}\right)=(-1,1,3)$; or $n$ even with $a_{0}=\cdots=a_{n}=-1$.","(Incorrect)

 Prove that $\sum_{(a, b) \in S_{AB}} (b - a) \neq \sum_{(a, b) \in S_{BA}} (a - b)$.","Let $X = \sum_{(a, b) \in S_{AB}} (b - a)$, $Y=\sum_{(a, b) \in S_{BA}} (a -b)$ and $Z=X-Y$. We first analyze the case where all elements of $A$ are smaller than all elements of $B$. In that case, $S_{BA} = 0$, and
 \[ X = \sum_{i = 1012}^{2022} \sum_{j = 1}^{1011} (i - j) = 1011 \cdot \left(\sum_{i = 1012}^{2022} i - \sum_{j = 1}^{1011} j \right) = 1011^3, \]
 and so $Z = 1011^3$.

 Now, arrange the numbers $1$ to $2022$ on a line in increasing order from left to right, and consider how the quantity $Z$ changes if we swap the set of two adjacent numbers, where the left number is in $A$ and the right number is in $B$. Let $A_l$ and $B_l$ be the number of numbers from $A$ and $B$ to the left of this adjacent pair, and similarly let $A_r$ and $B_r$ be the number of numbers from $A$ and $B$ to the right of this adjacent pair,

 First think of how $X$ changes. By moving the number from $A$ one unit to the right, we decrease each $A$-$B$ segment of $B_r$ by one unit. By moving the number from $B$ one unit to the left, we shorten each $A$-$B$ segments of $A_l$ by one unit. Also, we eliminated the length-1 $A$-$B$ segment formed by the swapped points themselves. Thus, $X$ decreases by $B_r + A_l + 1$.

 Similarly, $Y$ increases by $A_r + B_l + 1$, after the swap. Thus, $Z$ decreases by $B_r + R_l + B_r + B_l + 2 = 2022$.

 Now, starting from the initial configuration where all the 1011 left-most points are $A$, we can reach any other configuration by a series of swaps of adjacent pairs, where the left number is $A$ and the right number is $B$. In the initial configuration, we have $Z = 1011^3$, and it decreases by $2022$ with each swap. Thus, $Z$ always remains an odd number, so it can never be zero. We conclude that $X \neq Y$.","(Partial)

For a set $X$ as above let us denote with $m_{X}$ the smallest element in $X$. Find $\min m_{A}$ (for all $A$ with the above properties).","Partition the set $\{ 1,2,3,\cdots ,2000\}$ into 1000 parts $P_{1}\cup P_{2}\cup P_{3}\cup \cdots \cup P_{1000}$ such that $P_{a}$ contains all numbers of the form $2^{b}(2a-1)$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer.

 $A$ cannot have two elements from the same part (otherwise one would divide the other by a power of 2). So $A$ must have exactly one element from each part.

 Let $t_{a}$ be the element of $A$ contained in $P_{a}$. Then consider $t_{1},t_{2},t_{5},\cdots $, each being a product of a power of 3 and a power of 2. The highest power of 2 dividing $t_{1}$ must be strictly greater than the highest power of 2 dividing $t_{2}$ (otherwise $t_{1}$ divides $t_{2}$). Similarly, the highest powers of 2 dividing $t_{1},t_{2},t_{5},\cdots $ must be a strictly decreasing sequence. In particular, there are 7 numbers in the sequence, so $t_{1}$ must be at least $2^6=64$. In a similar manner, if $666<3^{b}(2a-1)<2000$, then $t_{a}\geq 2^{b}(2a-1)$. (Here we look at the numbers where the odd factors are $(2a-1)$ times a power of 3.)

 Suppose one of the $t_{a}$ is less than 64. Then we have
 \[666<3^{b}(2a-1)\leq (3/2)^{b}t_{a}<64(3/2)^{b}\]
 so that $b\geq 6$. However, this means either $a=1$ (we know $t_{1}\geq 64$) or $t_{a}\geq 3\cdot 2^{6}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, every element must be at least 64.


 We could attain a minimum by setting $t_{a}=2^{f(a)}(2a-1)$ where $f(a)$ satisfies $666<3^{f(a)}(2a-1)<2000$ if we can show it works. To do this, we must show that $t_{x}$ cannot divide $t_{y}$ for any $x\neq y$. Suppose there were such $x$ and $y$. Then
 \[2^{u}(2x-1)|2^{v}(2y-1)\]
 where $u=f(x)$ and $v=f(y)$. In particular, $u\leq v$ and $(2x-1)|(2y-1)$.

 In order to have $(2x-1)|(2y-1)$, we must have $2y-1\geq 3(2x-1)$, but this implies
 \[3^{u+1}(2x-1) \ge 2001 >3^{v}(2y-1)\geq 3^{v+1}(2x-1)\]
 and $u>v$, a contradiction! Therefore $\boxed{64}$ is the minimum.","(Partial)

 (2) Both paths allow only right or up movements (one unit each).

 (3) The $y$ coordinate of the first path never exceeds the y coordinate of the second path at any timestep.

If no two balls in the same box are the same color, prove that there are two colors that occur together in more than one box.","Let’s say a color ""connects"" two boxes if it appears in both. We want to show there are two colors that connect the same pair of boxes.

 Let $c_i$ denote the number of balls with color $i$. Then, the total number of times a color connects two boxes is $N = \sum_{i=1}^{22} \binom{c_i}{2}$. We also know the total number of balls is $48$, so $\sum_{i=1}^{22} c_i = 48$. We now try to find the minimum possible value of $N$.

 To do this, we first analyze the quantity $X = \sum_{i=1}^{22} (c_i - 2)^2$. If at $|c_i - 2| >= 2$ for some $i$, then clearly $X \ge 4$. Otherwise, all the $c_i$ are 1, 2, or 3. Then, in order for them to sum to 48, at most 18 of them can be 2, so once again $X \ge 4$. We then have

 $4 \le X = 2N - 3 \sum_{i=1}^{22} c_i + 4 * 22 = 2N - 3 * 48 + 4 * 22 = 2N - 56$,

 so that $N \ge 30$. But note that there are only $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ pairs of boxes. Thus, by the pigeonhole principle, some two colors connect the same pair of boxes, as desired.","(Partial)

 Let $\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{\delta(n)}{n}$ be $S(N)$.

 Let the greatest power of $2$ smaller or equal to $N$ be $2^k$. Then, $2^k \leq N <2^{k+1}$ holds. Using the observation, we get the following equation:
 $\sum_{n=1}^{2^k} \frac{\delta(n)}{n} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{2^{k-1-i}}{2^i} + \frac{1}{2^k} = 2^{k-1}(\frac{1-\frac{1}{4^{k}}}{\frac{3}{4}}) + \frac{1}{2^k}$

 Proof. Assume $p \mid q^2-q+1$ (so $p$ is odd); then $p \mid q^3+1$, so $q^3 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$, thus $q^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Let $\nu$ be the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $p$; then $\nu \mid 6$, and $\nu \mid p-1$ (by Fermat's Little theorem). That forces $\nu = 2$ (since $\nu = 1$ means $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, so $-1 \equiv q^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, forcing $p=2$, absurd), and so $q \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$. But then $0\equiv q^2-q+1 \equiv 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \pmod{p}$, forcing $p=3$, absurd.

 Step 2. Easily $a>3$, then $a^2=ab+b^3+1>2b+b^3+1>2b+b^2+1=(b+1)^2$, hence $a>b+1$; but then from $a\mid b^3+1=(b+1)(b^2-b+1)$ follows that $a\mid b^2-b+1$, hence $a\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$.

 Step 3. If $b\equiv 1\pmod{3}$, then $1=a^2-ab-b^3 \equiv 1-1-1 = -1 \pmod{3}$, a contradiction. If $b\equiv 2\pmod{3}$, then $1=a^2 - ab - b^3 \equiv 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 \pmod{3}$, a contradiction again.

 rewritten as:
 \[
 2^{c}\left(2^{a-c}-1\right)=7^{b}-1.
 \]

 We consider the following cases:


 \textbf{Case 1: $b$ is odd}

 In this case, $7^{b}-1\equiv2\pmod 4$, so $2^{c}=2$, which implies
 $c=1$. Substituting back into the equation, we have:
 \[
 2^{a}=7^{b}+1.
 \]

 On the other hand, note that $7^{b}+1=8(7^{b-1}-7^{b-2}+\cdots+7+1)$.
 If $b\ge3$ the second factor is an odd number greater than 1 which
 cannot divide $2^{a}$, contradiction. Therefore we have $b=1$ and
 $2^{a}=8$, so $a=3$. Hence, this case gives the solution $(a,b,c)=(3,1,1)$.


 \textbf{Case 2: $b$ is even but not divisible by $4$}

 Let $b=4k+2$, where $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Then:
 \[
 7^{b}-1=7^{4k+2}-1=\left(7^{2k+1}-1\right)\left(7^{2k+1}+1\right).
 \]

 Reasoning similarly to the previous case, we find that $7^{2k+1}-1$
 is divisible by $2$ but not by $4$, $7^{2k+1}+1$ is divisible by
 $8$ but not by $16$. Therefore, $7^{b}-1$ is divisible by $16$
 but not by $32$, which implies $c=4$. Substituting back into the
 equation, we have:
 \[
 2^{a}=7^{4k+2}+15.
 \]

 Since $7^{4k+2}+15\equiv1\pmod 3$, it follows that $2^{a}\equiv1\pmod 3$.
 Thus, $a$ is even. Let $a=2\ell$, where $\ell\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$,
 $\ell\geq2$ (since $x>z=4$). We can write:
 \[
 15=2^{2\ell}-7^{4k+2}=\left(2^{\ell}-7^{2k+1}\right)\left(2^{\ell}+7^{2k+1}\right).
 \]

 From here we easily obtain $\ell=3$ and $k=0$ which gives $a=6$
 and $b=2$. Thus, this case gives the solution $(a,b,c)=(6,2,4)$.


 \textbf{Case 3: $b$ is divisible by $4$}

 In this case, $7^{b}-1$ is divisible by $4^{2}=16$. Since $2^{a-c}-1$
 is divisible by $25$, $a-c$ is divisible by $\text{ord}_{25}(2)=20$.
 Then, $2^{a-c}-1$ is divisible by 31. Additionally:
 \[
 2^{a-c}-1\text{ is divisible by }31\implies7^{b}-1\text{ is divisible by }31.
 \]

 Note that $\text{ord}_{31}(7)=15$, so $b$ is divisible by $15$.
 However, in this case $7^{b}-1$ is also divisible by $9$, implying
 $a-c$ must be divisible by $6$ which implies that $2^{a-c}-1$ is
 divisible by $7$. Then, we find:
 \[
 7^{b}-1\text{ is divisible by }7,\text{ leading to a contradiction.}
 \]

 Hence, there are no solutions in this case.

 a quadratic residue modulo $11$. However, since $11$ has the form
 $4n+3$ we have $-1$ is a quadratic nonresdue, while $5$ is a quadratic
 residue modulo $11$ from the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. Hence,
 we have that $-5$ is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $11$, which a

Prove that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $A_{n}$ divides $n+2024$.","Let's look at the following lemma using the intermediate value property.

 <Lemma 1> If a sequence of non-negative integers $\left(x_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ satisfies $x_{n+1}-x_{n} \in\{0,1\}$ and for any $M>0$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}>M$, then there are infinitely many $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}$ is a positive integer.

 <Proof of Lemma 1> First, let $k_{0}$ be the smallest $k$ such that $x_{k} \geq 1$. Now, we will prove that for any integer $m \geq k_{0}$, there exists an $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}=m$.

 (1) There exists a positive integer $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}>m$, and let $n_{0}$ be the smallest such $n$. Since $\frac{k_{0}}{x_{k_{0}}} \leq k_{0}$, we have $n_{0} \geq k_{0}+1$.

 (2) By the minimality of $n_{0}$ and $n_{0} \geq k_{0}+1$, we have $\frac{n_{0}-1}{x_{n_{0}-1}} \leq m$. If $\frac{n_{0}-1}{x_{n_{0}-1}}<m$, then

 \[
 n_{0}<m x_{n_{0}-1}+1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n_{0} \leq m x_{n_{0}-1}.
 \]

 However, from $\frac{n_{0}}{x_{n_{0}}}>m$, we have $m x_{n_{0}}<n_{0}$, so combining the two results gives

 \[
 m x_{n_{0}-1} \geq n_{0}>m x_{n_{0}},
 \]

 which leads to $x_{n_{0}-1}>x_{n_{0}}$. This contradicts the condition of the problem that $x_{n+1}-x_{n} \in\{0,1\}$. Therefore, we must have $\frac{n_{0}-1}{x_{n_{0}-1}}=m$, and the proof is complete.

 Therefore, for any integer $m \geq k_{0}$, there exists an $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}=m$, and it is obvious that these values of $n$ are different for different $m$, so the proof is complete. \qed

 The following lemma is a Bernoulli-type inequality.

 <Lemma 2> For any integer $k \geq 2$, we have $2^{k} \geq \frac{k^{2}}{2}$.

 <Proof of Lemma 2> Since $k \geq 2$, by the binomial theorem, we have

 \[
 2^{k} \geq 1+k+\binom{k}{2}=1+\frac{k}{2}+\frac{k^{2}}{2}>\frac{k^{2}-k}{2},
 \]

 so the proof is complete. $\qed$

 Now, let's prove the main problem.

 <Step 1> Finding an upper bound for $A_{n}$

 <Step 1.1> For a positive integer $a$ and $k \geq 2$, let a number of the form $a^{k}$ be called a $k$-th power. Then, for any $k$-th power $a^{k}$ to be less than or equal to $n$, we must have

 \[
 a^{k} \leq n \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \leq n^{\frac{1}{k}},
 \]

 so the number of $k$-th powers less than or equal to $n$ is less than or equal to $n^{\frac{1}{k}}$.

 <Step 1.2> If any $k$-th power other than 1 is less than or equal to $n$, then we must have $2^{k} \leq n$, so $k \leq \log _{2} n$.

 <Step 1.3> By (1) and (2) above, $A_{n}$ satisfies the following:

 \[
 A_{n} \leq \sum_{k=2}^{\left[\log _{2} n\right]} n^{\frac{1}{k}} \leq\left(\left[\log _{2} n\right]-1\right) n^{\frac{1}{2}}<\log _{2} n \cdot n^{\frac{1}{2}}.
 \]

 <Step 2> Solving the problem using the lemma

 Now, let the sequence $\left(x_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be defined as $x_{n}=0$ if $n \leq 2024$ and $x_{n}=A_{n-2024}$ for $n \geq 2025$.

 <Step 2.1> Since $A_{1}=1$ and $A_{n+1}-A_{n}$ is 1 if $n+1$ is a perfect power and 0 otherwise, $x_{n}$ satisfies $x_{n+1}-x_{n} \in\{0,1\}$ for any $n \geq 1$.

 <Step 2.2> By <Step 1>, we have $A_{2^{2 k}} \leq 2 k \cdot 2^{k}$, so by <Lemma 2>, we have

 \[
 \frac{2^{2 k}}{A_{2^{2 k}}} \geq \frac{2^{k}}{2 k} \geq \frac{k}{4}.
 \]

 Since $A_{n}$ is an increasing sequence, we have $A_{n} \geq x_{n}$, so $\frac{n}{x_{n}} \geq \frac{n}{A_{n}}$. Combining these results gives

 \[
 \frac{2^{2 k}}{x_{2^{2 k}}} \geq \frac{2^{2 k}}{A_{2^{2 k}}} \geq \frac{k}{4},
 \]

 so for any $M>0$, there exists an $n$ such that $\frac{n}{x_{n}}>M$.

 <Step 2.3> By (1), (2), and <Lemma 1> above, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $x_{n} \mid n$. Therefore, there are also infinitely many $n$ such that

 \[
 \frac{n+2024}{A_{n}}=\frac{n+2024}{x_{n+2024}}
 \]

 is a positive integer.","(Partial)

PB-Advanced-002,"There are 120 students in DeepMind highschool, and each student `loves' some of the students. Here `love' is not always a mutual relationship; a student A may love B while B may not love A, and it is also possible that a student loves oneself. For the set $F$ of all $2^{120}$ subsets of the students, define the function $f: F \rightarrow F$ as the function that maps each $X \in F$ to the set of students loved by one or more students in $X$. For $A, B \in F$, $A$ and $B$ are said to have a 'lovely relationship' iff there exists a natural number $k$ such that $f^{k}(A)=B$. Now we want to select distinct elements $A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots A_{t}$ from $F$ such that for any $1 \leq i<j \leq t$, $A_{i}$ and $A_{j}$ have a lovely relationship. Let $M(f)$ be the maximum possible value of $t$.  Show that $M(f) \leq 2^{70}$. ","To being with, we prove there must be some $A \in F$ such that $\left\{A_{1}, \cdots A_{t}\right\} \subset \cup_{i=0}^{\infty}\left\{f^{i}(A)\right\}$. Why is this? Consider a graph $H$ with $A_{1}, A_{2}, \cdots A_{t}$ as its vertices. If $f^{k}\left(A_{i}\right)=A_{j}$ for some $k$, draw a directed edge $A_{i} \rightarrow A_{j}$ to create a directed graph. This graph is a tournament. Now, if there is a vertex $A$ such that $d^{-}(A)=0$, then it holds directly. If not, then in this graph, the in-degree of any vertex is at least 1. This means the graph contains a cycle. Having a cycle means that for each element $A$ in the cycle, there is some $T$ such that $f^{T}(A)=A$. Therefore, for two vertices $A, B$ in the cycle, if $f^{i}(A)=B$, then $f^{T-i}(B)=A$. This means any two vertices in the cycle can reach each other via applications of $f$. Now, if we remove all but one vertex from the cycle and then use induction on the number of vertices, we can immediately find that there is a vertex $A$ such that $d^{+}(A)=t-1$. Thus, we can obtain our desired conclusion.

Now, considering a directed graph $G$ whose vertices are the students and where an edge $i \rightarrow j$ is drawn if student $i$ loves student $j$, we need to find $\max_{A_0 \in F} \left| \{f^i(A_0) \mid i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \} \right|$. Now, in $G$, let's perform the following procedure: \begin{itemize} \item Pick any cycle in $G$ and call it $C_{1}$. \item Pick any cycle in $G-C_{1}$ (the graph after removing all vertices of $C_1$) and call it $C_{2}$. \item Repeat this procedure until no more cycles can be found. \end{itemize} As a result of this procedure, we will have disjoint cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \cdots, C_{m}$, and a graph $H$ (which is $G - \bigcup C_i$) that has no cycles. Let $a_i$ be the number of vertices in $C_i$, and let $|V(H)|=x$. Then $a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{m}=n-x \leq n$ (where $n=120$). Let $L =c\operatorname{lcm}\left[a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{m}\right]$, where $c$ is the smallest positive integer such that $L\ge n$.
\\Consider some nonempty $A \subset V(G)$. Now, if we define $T(k) = \bigcup_{j=1}^{m} (f^{k}(A) \cap C_{j})$, then since each $|f^{k}(A) \cap C_{j}|$ is non-decreasing, $|T(k)|$ is a non-decreasing function. Now let's look at $|T(L)|, \cdots, |T((2n+1)L)|$. Since $|T(k)| \leq |V(G)|=n$ and $|T(k)|$ is non-decreasing, there exists some $i$ such that $|T(iL)|=|T((i+1)L)|=|T((i+2)L)|$. At this point, by the definition of $L$, it must be that $T(iL) \subset T((i+1)L) \subset T((i+2)L)$, and therefore $T(iL)=T((i+1)L)=T((i+2)L)$. Therefore, for each $1 \leq r < L$, $T(iL+r)=T((i+1)L+r)$ also holds.
\\Now, if $f^{(i+2)L}(A) \neq f^{(i+1)L}(A)$, then there must be a $v_{0} \in f^{(i+2)L}(A) \triangle f^{(i+1)L}(A)$ (symmetric difference; $A \triangle B=(A-B) \cup (B-A)$), and in this case, $v_{0} \in H$ must hold. Therefore, there also exists $v_1 \in f^{(i+2)L-1}(A) \triangle f^{(i+1)L-1}(A)$ (from which $v_0$ is reached), and $v_2 \in \dots$, so we can keep finding $v_j$ such that there is a path $v_k \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow v_0$. If $v_1 , v_2, \cdots, v_{|V(H)|+1}$ are all in $H$, then some point should appear at least twice, which is a contradiction to the fact that $H$ has no cycles. Therefore, there exists some $k \le n$ such that $v_k \not \in H$, or equivalently  $v_k \in \bigcup C_j$. However, since $v_k \in f^{(i+2)L -k} (A) \triangle f^{(i+1)L -k} (A)$ where $k \le n \le L$, this is a contradiction to the observation above that $T(iL+r)=T((i+1)L+r)$ for each $1\le r \le L$.

Thus, $f^{(i+2)L}(A)=f^{(i+1)L}(A)$ and thus it follows that $\left\{f^{j}(A) \mid j \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}\right\}=\left\{f^{j}(A) \mid j \leq (i+1)L \right\}$. Since $i <2n$, we can conclude that $M(f) \leq 2nL$.

 <Step 1> Finding a point on the radical axis of circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$

 By the well-known property of Mixtilinear circles, $AT_A$ is isogonal to the line joining the point of tangency of the excircle opposite to vertex $A$ and vertex $A$.
 Similarly, consider the lines joining the points of tangency of the excircles opposite to vertices $B$ and $C$ with their respective vertices. It is well-known that these three lines intersect at a single point, the Nagel point.
 Therefore, lines $AT_A$, $BT_B$, and $CT_C$ also intersect at a single point, which is the isogonal conjugate of the Nagel point. Let this point be $T$.
 Clearly, $T$ lies on segments $AT_A$, $BT_B$, and $CT_C$, and is inside circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$.

 Furthermore, by the power of a point theorem with respect to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$, we have
 \[AT \cdot TT_A = BT \cdot TT_B = CT \cdot TT_C.\]
 Therefore, point $T$ has the same power with respect to circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C.$

 Hence, to prove the statement, it is sufficient to find another point that has the same power with respect to circles $\Gamma_A$, $\Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$.

 <Step 2> $(A, D, T_A, S_A)$ is cyclic

 $\angle ADS_A = \frac{\angle A}{2} + \angle C = \angle ACN = \angle A T_A SA$, so $(A, D, T_A, S_A)$ is cyclic.

 <Step 3> $\angle AIS_A = 90^\circ$

  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $BIC$ and $NITA$ is the line passing through $I$ and perpendicular to $AI$.
  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $BIC$ and $ABC$ is $BC$.
  \item The radical axis of the circumcircles of triangles $ABC$ and $NITA$ is $NT_A$.
 \end{itemize}
 Therefore, the intersection point $S_A$ of $BC$ and $NT_A$ satisfies $\angle AIS_A = 90^\circ$.

 <Step 4> Inversion with respect to the incircle of triangle $ABC$

 Now, let's invert the figure with respect to the incircle $I$. In particular, let's pay attention to which circle $I$ maps to under this inversion.
 Let $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ be the images of points $A$, $B$, and $C$ under the inversion. Also, let $D'$ and $S_A'$ be the images of points $D$ and $S_A$ under the inversion.

 Let's investigate the properties of the inverted points.
 Since $DA_1$ is tangent to the circle, $D'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $ID$. $A'$ is the midpoint of $B_1C_1$. Finally, since $SA_1$ is tangent to the circle, $S_A'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $IS_A$.
 By the conclusion of Step 3, $A_1S_A'$ is parallel to $AI$.
 By the observation from step 2, the inversion of the circumcircle of $ADT_A$ is the circumcircle of triangle $A'S_A'D'$. Similarly, the circumcircles of $B'S_B'E'$ and $C'S_C'F'$ are our desired circles. Let's prove that the three circumcircles pass through two common points.

 <Step 5> The circumcircles of triangles $A'S_A'D', B'S_B'E'$, and $C'S_C'F'$ pass through two common points

 Now, let's consider the figure with respect to triangle $A_1B_1C_1$.

 In triangle $A_1B_1C_1$, point $I$ is the circumcenter. Let $H_1$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $B_1C_1$.
 Then, points $A'$, $S_A'$, and $D'$ are constructed as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Point $A'$ is the midpoint of $B_1C_1$.
  \item Point $D'$ is the intersection of the line parallel to $B_1C_1$ passing through $A_1$ and the perpendicular bisector of $B_1C_1$.
  \item Point $S_A'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to $AH_1$.
 \end{itemize}
 Through this construction, we can find that the circumcenter $O_A$ of triangle $A'S_A'D'$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A'D'$, which is the line $B'C'$.
 Now, let's consider the point $O_A'$ which is the reflection of $O_A$ with respect to the midpoint of $B'C'$.

 <Step 6> $O_A'$ is the circumcenter of triangle $A_1IH_1$

 Since $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, and $H_1$ lie on the nine-point circle of triangle $ABC$, these four points are concyclic. Therefore, quadrilateral $A'H_1 B'C'$ is an isosceles trapezoid, and points $A'$ and $H_1$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of line $B_1 C_1$.
 Furthermore, $A_1$ and $D'$ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of line $B'C'$.
 Therefore, triangle $AIH_1$ is the reflection of triangle $A'S_A'D'$ across the perpendicular bisector of line $B'C'$, and the circumcenters $O_A$ and $O_A'$ are also symmetric with respect to each other.

 <Step 7> $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are collinear

 Now, let's define $O_B, O_C, O_B'$, and $O_C'$ similarly, and show that $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are collinear.
 First, let's show that $O_A'$, $O_B'$, and $O_C'$ are collinear. It is sufficient to prove that the circumcircles of triangles $AIH_1$, $BIH_B$, and $C_1IH_C$ have a common radical axis.
 On the other hand, the circumcenter $I$ of $ABC$ and the orthocenter $A_1H_A \cap B_1H_B \cap C_1H_C$ have the same power with respect to these three circumcircles. Therefore, these three circles have a common radical axis. Hence, the centers of these three circles, $O_A'$, $O_B'$, and $O_C'$, are collinear.
 Now, by Menelaus' theorem, we have
 \[\frac{C'O_A' \cdot B'O_C' \cdot A'O_B'}{O_A'B' \cdot O_C'A' \cdot O_B'C'} = 1\]
 \[\frac{C'O_A \cdot B'O_C \cdot A'O_B}{O_AB' \cdot O_CA' \cdot O_BC'} = 1\]
 Therefore, $O_A, O_B$, and $O_C$ are also collinear.

 <Step 8> Circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ have two common points

 Now, the circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ are inverted into circles. The centers of these three circles are collinear, as proven earlier. Therefore, these three circles either have a common radical axis or their radical axes are parallel. This property remains true before the inversion.
 However, in Step 1, we found point $T$ that has the same power with respect to these three circles. Therefore, circles $\Gamma_A, \Gamma_B$, and $\Gamma_C$ have a common radical axis.
 Furthermore, since point $T$ lies inside all three circles, this common radical axis intersects each circle at two distinct points. Therefore, the three circles have two common points.","(Partial)

Prove that we can choose two of these diagonals such that the three parts of $P$ divided by these two diagonals each contain at least $3n$ and at most $9n$ triangles.","First, let's look at the following well-known theorem.

 <Lemma>
 For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the following four statements are equivalent. Therefore, if one of them holds, $G$ is a tree.

 (A) $G$ is connected and has no cycles.

 (B) $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges.

 (C) $G$ has $n-1$ edges and no cycles.

 (D) There is exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$.

 The following lemma is a general fact about the division of trees.

 For a positive integer $k \geq 2$, if the degree of each vertex in a tree is at most $k$, then we can remove an edge from the tree so that both resulting connected components have size at least $\frac{n-1}{k}$.

 <Proof of Lemma>

 (1) Let $H_{e}, K_{e}$ be the two connected components obtained by removing an edge $e$ from the tree, and let $h_{e}, k_{e}$ be the number of vertices in the two components. (Of course, $h_{e}+k_{e}=n$.) Let $l=\{x, y\}$ be the edge for which $\min \left(h_{e}, k_{e}\right)$ is maximized. (If there are multiple such edges, choose one arbitrarily)

 (2) Assume for contradiction that the smaller component obtained by removing $l$ has size less than $\frac{n-1}{k}$. Without loss of generality, let this be the component containing $x$. Let this component be $A$.

 (3) Now, for any edge $e$ other than $l$ connected to vertex $y$, if we remove that edge instead of $l$, let $H_{e}$ be the component containing $l$ and $K_{e}$ be the other component. Then $H_{e}$ contains $A$, so it is larger than $A$. If the number of vertices in $H_{e}$ is less than or equal to the number of vertices in $K_{e}$, then it contradicts the maximality of $A$. Therefore, the number of vertices in $K_{e}$ must be less than the number of vertices in $H_{e}$. Therefore, by the maximality of $A$, the number of vertices in $K_{e}$ is less than or equal to the number of vertices in $A$, and therefore less than $\frac{n-1}{k}$.

 (4) Therefore, when we remove each edge adjacent to vertex $y$, each resulting connected component has less than $\frac{n-1}{k}$ vertices. Since the degree of vertex $y$ is at most $k$, there are at most $k$ such components, and therefore the number of vertices excluding $y$ is less than $\frac{n-1}{k} \times k=n-1$, which is a contradiction.

 Therefore, the proof is complete. \qed

 Now, let's prove the problem. First, let's look at the general properties of triangulation of a convex $n$-gon before looking at the convex $18n+2$-gon.

 <Step 1> Basic properties of triangulation of a convex polygon

 <Step 1.1> The sum of the interior angles of a convex $n$-gon is $(n-2) \pi$. Therefore, in order for triangles with an interior angle sum of $\pi$ to divide this sum, we need a total of $n-2$ triangles. Since each time we draw a diagonal, the division of the convex $n$-gon increases by one, we know that if we have divided a convex $n$-gon into $n-2$ triangles, we have drawn a total of $n-3$ diagonals. In summary, to triangulate a convex $n$-gon, we need to draw $n-3$ diagonals to divide it into $n-2$ triangles.

 <Step 1.2> If $n \geq 4$, then there are $n-2$ triangles, and each triangle cannot have all 3 sides as sides of the convex $n$-gon. Therefore, there must be at least 2 triangles that share 2 sides with the convex $n$-gon.

 <Step 2> Mapping triangulation of a convex polygon to a tree

 The problem of dividing a convex $n$-gon $P$ into triangles is directly related to trees. For convenience, assume $n \geq 4$. Let's consider the triangles as vertices and connect two vertices if the corresponding triangles share a side to draw a graph $G$.

 <Step 2.1> By <Step 1>, this graph has $n-2$ vertices and $n-3$ edges. (This is because each diagonal drawn during the division corresponds to one edge in $G$.)

 <Step 2.2> We can confirm that this graph $G$ is connected by mathematical induction. The case $n=4$ is trivial. Now, assume that $G$ is connected for triangulations of convex $n-1$-gons for $n \geq 5$, and consider a triangulation $T$ of a convex $n$-gon $P$. By (2) of <Step 1>, this triangulation includes a triangle $X$ that has two consecutive sides of $P$.

 <Step 2.3> The vertex corresponding to this triangle $X$ has degree 1 in graph $G$. Let $Y$ be the vertex connected to $X$. Now, the remaining part of the $n$-gon $P$ excluding triangle $X$ is an $n-1$-gon $P^{\prime}$, and if we remove triangle $X$ from triangulation $T$, the remaining part is $T^{\prime}$, which is a triangulation of $P^{\prime}$. Let $G^{\prime}$ be the graph for this triangulation. Clearly, $G^{\prime}$ is the graph obtained by removing vertex $X$ and edge $XY$ from $G$. By the inductive hypothesis, $G^{\prime}$ is connected, so the graph $G$ obtained by adding edge $XY$ to it is also connected.

 In conclusion, graph $G$ is a connected graph with $n-2$ vertices and $n-3$ edges. Therefore, by -(B), $G$ is a tree.

 <Step 3> Analysis of the problem situation

 <Step 3.1> According to the above analysis, we can see that the triangulation given in the problem corresponds to a tree $T$ with $18n$ vertices. It is very important that the degree of each vertex in this tree is at most 3.

 <Step 3.2> Choosing two diagonals to divide the convex $18n+2$-gon can be thought of as removing two edges from this tree to divide it into three connected components. The question is whether we can do this so that the size of each connected component is at least $3n-1$ and at most $8n+1$.

 <Step 4> Solving the problem

 <Step 4.1> First, the tree $T$ corresponding to the triangulation has $18n$ vertices, and the degree of each vertex is at most 3. Therefore, by Lemma, we can remove one edge to make the sizes of the two resulting components at least $6n-1$.

 <Step 4.2> Let $A$ be the component with fewer vertices and $B$ be the component with more vertices (if the sizes are the same, assign $A$ and $B$ arbitrarily). The number of vertices in $A$ is at least $6n-1$ and at most $9n$, and the number of vertices in $B$ is at least $9n$ and at most $12n+1$.

 <Step 4.3> Since $B$ is also a tree with degree at most 3, we can apply again to $B$. By removing one edge from $B$, we can divide it into $B_{1}, B_{2}$ so that the size of each component is at least $\frac{9n-1}{3}$ and at most $\frac{2(12 n+1)+1}{3}=8 n+1$. Therefore, the sizes of $B_{1}, B_{2}$ are at least $3n$ and at most $8n+1$.

 <Step 4.4> Therefore, we can divide it into $A, B_{1}, B_{2}$.","(Partial)

 step 1-1: Without loss of generality we may assume that $XA\perp YZ$
 and $ZA\perp YX$.

 step 1-2: Let $D$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle XYZ$.

 step 1-3: Let $\theta=180^{\circ}-2\angle XYZ$.

 \medskip{}

 step 2: We prove that if $\angle BAC=\angle XYZ$, then $\angle BDC=\theta$.

 \medskip{}

 step 3: Lemma. A point $K$ inside a convex quadrilateral $PQRS$
 has an isogonal conjugate with respect to the $PQRS$ if and only
 if $\angle PKQ+\angle RKS=180^{\circ}$.

 \medskip{}

 step 4: Proof of Lemma.

 step 4-1: Let $H_{1},H_{2},H_{3},H_{4}$ be the feet of perpendicular
 from $K$ onto $PQ,QR,RS,SP$, respectively.

 step 4-2: First assume that $K^{\prime}$ is the isogonal conjugate
 of $K$

 step 4-2-1: Let $H_{1}^{\prime},H_{2}^{\prime},H_{3}^{\prime},H_{4}^{\prime}$
 be the feet of perpendicular from $K^{\prime}$ onto $PQ,QR,RS,SP$,
 respectively.

 step 4-2-2: We prove that $H_{1},H_{2},H_{1}^{\prime},H_{2}^{\prime}$
 are cyclic.

 step 4-2-2-1: We have $\angle KQH_{1}=\angle K^{\prime}QH_{2}^{\prime}$
 by assumption.

 step 4-2-2-2: We have $\angle KH_{1}Q=\angle K^{\prime}H_{2}^{\prime}Q=90^{\circ}$.

 step 4-2-2-3: By steps 4-2-2-1 and 4-2-2-2, we have $\triangle KQH_{1}\sim\triangle K^{\prime}QH_{2}^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-2-4: Thus $QH_{1}:QH_{2}^{\prime}=KQ:K^{\prime}Q$.

 step 4-2-2-5: Similarly $QH_{1}^{\prime}:QH_{2}=KQ:K^{\prime}Q$.

 step 4-2-2-6: By steps 4-2-2-4 and 4-2-2-5, we have $QH_{1}\times QH_{1}^{\prime}=QH_{2}\times QH_{2}^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-2-7: Hence $H_{1},H_{2},H_{1}^{\prime},H_{2}^{\prime}$ are
 cyclic.

 step 4-2-3: Denote $M$ as the midpoint of $KK^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-4: We prove that $H_{1},H_{1}^{\prime},H_{2},H_{2}^{\prime}$
 are equidistant to $M$.

 step 4-2-4-1: Let $N$ be the midpoint of $H_{1}H_{1}^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-4-2: Since $H_{1}K\parallel H_{1}^{\prime}K^{\prime}$ and
 both are perpendicular to $PQ$, we have $NM\perp PQ$.

 step 4-2-4-3: Hence $M$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $H_{1}H_{1}^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-4-4: Similarly $M$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of
 $H_{2}H_{2}^{\prime}$.

 step 4-2-4-5: By steps 4-2-2, 4-2-4-3, 4-2-4-4 and the fact that $PQ$
 and $QR$ are not parallel, we have that the center should be $M$.

 step 4-2-5: Similarly $H_{2},H_{2}^{\prime},H_{3},H_{3}^{\prime}$
 are equidistant to $M$, and $H_{3},H_{3}^{\prime},H_{4},H_{4}^{\prime}$
 are equidistant to $M$.

 step 4-2-6: By steps 4-2-4 and 4-2-5, $H_{1},H_{1}^{\prime},H_{2},H_{2}^{\prime},H_{3},H_{3}^{\prime},H_{4},H_{4}^{\prime}$
 all lie on a circle centered at $M$.

 step 4-2-7: Since $\angle KH_{1}Q=\angle KH_{2}Q=90^{\circ}$, $K,H_{1},Q,H_{2}$
 are cyclic.

 step 4-2-8: Similarly $K,H_{2},R,H_{3}$ are cyclic.

 step 4-2-9: Similarly $K,H_{3},S,H_{4}$ are cyclic.

 step 4-2-10: Similarly $K,H_{4},P,H_{1}$ are cyclic.

 step 4-2-11: By steps 4-2-6, 4-2-7, 4-2-8, 4-2-9, and 4-2-10, we have

 step 4-3: Assume $\angle PKQ+\angle RKS=180^{\circ}$.

 step 4-3-1: By the same logic as in step 4-2, $H_{1},H_{2},H_{3},H_{4}$ lie on a circle $\omega$.

 step 4-3-2: Let $O$ be the center of $\omega$.

 step 4-3-3: Denote $J_{1},J_{2},J_{3},J_{4}$as the second intersection
 of $\omega$ and $PQ,QR,RS,SP$, respectively.

 step 4-3-4: Let $K^{\prime}$ be the reflection of $K$ with respect
 to $O$.

 step 4-3-5: Let $N^{\prime}$ be the midpoint of $H_{1}J_{1}$.

 step 4-3-6: Since $KH_{1}\parallel ON^{\prime}$ and both are perpendicular
 to $PQ$, we have $K^{\prime}J_{1}\perp PQ$.

 step 4-3-7: Similarly $K^{\prime}J_{2}\perp QR$.

 step 4-3-8: Hence $\angle PQK=\angle H_{1}QK=90^{\circ}-\angle H_{1}KQ=90^{\circ}-\angle H_{1}H_{2}Q=90^{\circ}-\angle J_{2}J_{1}Q=\angle RQK^{\prime}$.

 step 4-3-9: Similarly $K,K^{\prime}$ are isogonal with respect to
 all four angles of $PQRS$.

 step 4-3-10: Thus $K^{\prime}$ is the isogonal conjugate of $K$
 with respect to $PQRS$.\medskip{}

 step 5: Now suppose $\angle BAC=\angle XYZ$.

 step 5-1: Since $\angle XYZ$ is acute, $\triangle XYZ$ is acute,
 and $\angle XAY,\angle ZAY>90^{\circ}>\angle BAC$.

 step 5-2: Hence $\square BCZX$ is convex, and $K$ is inside of $\square BCZX$.\medskip{}

 step 6: We prove that $D$ is the isogonal conjugate of $A$ with
 respect to $\square BCZX$.

 step 6-1: We have $\angle ZAX+\angle BAC=(180^{\circ}-\angle XYZ)+\angle XYZ=180^{\circ}$.

 step 6-2: Hence by Lemma and steps 5-2, 6-1, $A$ has an isogonal
 conjugate with respect to $\square BCZX$.

 step 6-3: $A,D$ are isogonal conjugates with respect to $\triangle XYZ$
 as orthocenter and circumcenter.

 step 6-4: By step 6-3, $XA,XD$ are isogonal lines with respect to
 $\angle BXZ$, and $ZA,ZD$ are isogonal lines with respect to $\angle CZX$.

 step 6-5: By steps 6-2, 6-4, and the fact that there is at most one
 isogonal conjugate, we conclude that $D$ is indeed the isogonal conjugate.

 \medskip{}

 step 7: We prove that $\angle BDC=180^{\circ}-2\angle XYZ$.

 step 7-1: By step 6, $A$ is the isogonal conjugate of $D$ with respect
 to $\square BCZX$.

 step 7-2: By Lemma, we have $\angle BDC+\angle XDZ=180^{\circ}$.

 step 7-3: Since $D$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle XYZ$, we have
 $\angle XDZ=2\angle XYZ$.

 step 7-4: By step 7-2 and 7-3, we have $\angle BDC=180^{\circ}-2\angle XYZ$.

 If $f$ is constant, $f\equiv0$ or $f\equiv1$. From now on we will
 only consider non-constant functions.

 Claim 1 $f(f(x))=f(x)$ for all $x\in\mathbb{Z}$

 Proof. $P(0,y):f(-f(0))=f(0)f(1-y)\Longrightarrow f(0)=0$

 $P(x,0):f(x)=f(x)f(1)\Longrightarrow f(1)=1$

 $P(1,y):f(1-f(y))=f(1-y)$

 $P(1,1-y):f(1-f(1-y))=f(y)$

 $P(1,1-f(y)):f(y)=f(1-f(1-y))=f(1-f(1-f(y)))=f(f(y))\Longrightarrow f(f(x))=f(x)\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}\blacksquare$

 $\Longrightarrow P(x,1):f(x-f(x))=0$

 Now consider $f(\mathbb{Z})$.

 Case 1 $f(\mathbb{Z})\subset\{-1,0,1\}$

 Case 1.1. $f(\mathbb{Z})=\{0,1\}$

 We have $f(x)=1\textbackslash \Longrightarrow f(x-1)=0\textbackslash \Longrightarrow
 f(2-x)=1 \textbackslash \Longrightarrow f(1-x)=0$ and $f(1-x)=0
 \textbackslash \Longrightarrow f(x)=1$

 \[
 \therefore f(x)=1\Longleftrightarrow f(x-1)=0\Longleftrightarrow f(2-x)=1\Longleftrightarrow f(1-x)=0
 \]
 We can inductively prove that $f(x)=\begin{cases}
 0 & 2|x

 1 & 2\nmid x
 \end{cases}$

 Case 1.2. $f(\mathbb{Z})=\{-1,0,1\}\Longrightarrow f(-1)=-1$

 $P(1,x)$ and $P(-1,x)$ gives

 \begin{align*}
 f(x)=1 & \Longrightarrow f(1-x)=0,f(x+1)=-f(-2)

 f(x)=0 & \Longrightarrow f(1-x)=1,f(x+1)=1

 f(x)=-1 & \Longrightarrow f(1-x)=f(2),f(x+1)=0
 \end{align*}
 It's easy to see that $f(-2)=1,f(2)=-1$, and using this, we can inductively
 prove that $f(x)=\begin{cases}
 0 & 3|x

 1 & 3|x-1

 -1 & 3|x+1
 \end{cases}$

 Case 2. $f(\mathbb{Z})$ is not a subset of $\{-1,0,1\}$

 Case 2.1 $f(t)=1$ for some $2\mid t$

 \[
 P(2,\frac{t}{2}):1=f(1)=f(2)f(1-\frac{t}{2})
 \]

 Case 2.1.1 : $f(2)=1\Longrightarrow P(2,1):1=f(2)f(0)=0$. Contradiction!

 Case 2.1.2 : $f(2)=-1\Longrightarrow f(-1)=-1,f(1-\frac{t}{2})=-1$

 $P(-1,-x):f(-1-f(x))=-f(1+x)$

 $P(-1,-f(x)):f(-1-f(x))=f(-1-f(f(x)))=-f(1+f(x))\Longrightarrow f(1+x)=f(1+f(x))...(*)$

 Since $f(2)=-1$, so plugging this in $(*)$, we have

 \[
 f(2)=-1\Longrightarrow f(3)=0\Longrightarrow f(4)=1\Longrightarrow f(5)=-1\cdots
 \]
 We can prove inductively that$f(x)=\begin{cases}
 0 & 3|x

 1 & 3|x-1

 -1 & 3|x+1
 \end{cases}$ for all $x\in\mathbb{N}$.

 Plugging in $x=-1,y=-n(n\in\mathbb{N})$ gives $f(-1-n)=f(-1-f(n))=-f(1+n)$,
 so we have $f(x)=\begin{cases}
 0 & 3|x

 1 & 3|x-1

 -1 & 3|x+1
 \end{cases}$for all $x$, so contradiction since $f(\mathbb{Z})\in\{-1,0,1\}$.

 Case 2.2 $f(t)=1\Longrightarrow2\nmid t$

 Claim 2 $f(-1)=-1$ or $f(2)=0$

 Proof. Assume that $f(2)\neq0$

 We will prove that $f(t)=1\Longrightarrow f(1-t)=0$. $P(2,\frac{1-t}{2})$
 gives

 \[
 f(2)=f(2)f(\frac{t-3}{2})\Longrightarrow f(\frac{t-3}{2})=1
 \]
 We repeat this, then we get $t\equiv1(mod2^{n})$ for all $n\Longrightarrow t=1$.
 Note that

 \[
 f(-1)=c\Longrightarrow f(-1-c)=0\Longrightarrow f(c+2)=1
 \]
 Hence we conclude that $c=-1$.

 Case 2.2.1. $f(2)=0\Longrightarrow f(-1)=1$

 Define $n$ as the element of $f(\mathbb{Z})-\{-1,0,1\}$ which has
 the smallest absolute value. Then we have

 \[
 f(x-f(xy))=n\Longrightarrow\{f(x),f(1-y)\}=\{1,n\}\text{ or }\{f(x),f(1-y)\}=\{-1,-n\}...(\star)
 \]
 . Also note that $P(-n,- 1):f(-n-f(n))=0$, where $f(n)=n$ by Claim 1. Thus by $x=n,y=-2$ $(\star)\Longrightarrow f(3)=1$.
 Case 2.2.1. now becomes a repetition of Case 1.1, so contradiction!

 Case 2.2.2. $f(2)\neq0,f(-1)=-1,f(-2)=-f(2)$

 Claim 3 $f(n)=t\Longrightarrow n=t\forall t\leq1$

 Proof. We use induction on $t$. $t=1$ is already proven above. Assume
 that $t$ works.

 If $f(n)=t-1\Longrightarrow f(1+n)=f(1+f(n))=f(t)\Longrightarrow n=t-1$,

 \[
 P(Q(x)-x-1)=Q(P(x))
 \]","<Step 1> Checking the possibility of recursive construction using induction

 <Step 1.1> Let's assume that two polynomials $P_{0}$ and $Q_{0}$ satisfy the polynomial equation given in the problem as follows:

 \[
 P_{0}\left(Q_{0}(x)-x-1\right)=Q_{0}\left(P_{0}(x)\right)
 \]

 <Step 1.2> For a positive integer $n$, let's define the polynomial $P_{n}(x)$ recursively as follows:

 \[
 P_{n}(x)=P_{n-1}\left(Q_{0}(x)-x-1\right); n \geq 1
 \]

 <Step 1.3> Let's prove by mathematical induction that for any non-negative integer $n$, $(P_{n}, Q_{0})$ also satisfies the given polynomial equation.

 *(1)* First, we have already confirmed that the case $n=0$ holds.

 *(2)* Next, let's assume that the case $n=k$ holds, i.e., assume that $(P_{k}, Q_{0})$ is also a solution to the polynomial equation. Then, by the induction hypothesis and the recursive formula for $P_{n}$ defined above, we have

 \[
 P_{k+1}(x)=P_{k}\left(Q_{0}(x)-x-1\right)=Q_{0}\left(P_{k}(x)\right)
 \]

 Now, substituting $x=Q_{0}(y)-y-1$, we get

 \[
 P_{k+1}\left(Q_{0}(y)-y-1\right)=Q_{0}\left(P_{k}\left(Q_{0}(y)-y-1\right)\right)=Q_{0}\left(P_{k+1}(y)\right)
 \]

 Therefore, we can see that the proposition holds for the case $n=k+1$.

 <Step 2> Initialization

 <Step 2.1> As we saw in <Step 1>, if we find an initial solution $(P_{0}, Q_{0})$, we can continuously generate solutions. In particular, looking at the recursive formula for $P_{n}$, if the degree of $Q_{0}$ is at least 2, the degree of $P_{n}$ is twice the degree of $P_{n-1}$, which continuously increases. Therefore, by repeating this process, we can eventually make the degree of $P_{n}$ greater than 2024.

 <Step 2.2> Therefore, to find an initial solution, let's first try $P_{0}$ as a linear polynomial and $Q_{0}$ as a quadratic polynomial. It is easy to see that there are no possible cases. If both $P_{0}$ and $Q_{0}$ are quadratic polynomials, substituting $P_{0}(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c$, $Q_{0}(x)=ux^{2}+vx+w$ and using the method of undetermined coefficients, we find that

 \[
 P_{0}(x)=x^{2}+\frac{5}{2} x, \quad Q_{0}(x)=x^{2}+\frac{7}{2} x+\frac{3}{2}
 \]

 is a solution to the polynomial equation $P_{0}\left(Q_{0}(x)-x-1\right)=Q_{0}\left(P_{0}(x)\right)$.

 <Step 2.3> Now, repeating <Step 1> based on this initial solution, $(P_{n}, Q_{0})$ is also a solution for any $n$, and in particular, the degree of $P_{11}$ is 2048, which is greater than 2024.","(Partial)

 Prove that for any positive integers $a, c$ and integer $b$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the following expression is an integer:

 \[
 \frac{a^{F_{n}}+n-b}{c}.
 \]","First, let's prove the following Lemma, which is an extension of Euler's theorem.

 <Lemma 1> Given positive integers $n$ and $a$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for any positive integer $k \geq N$, $a^{k+\phi(n)} \equiv a^{k}(\bmod n)$ holds.

 <Proof of Lemma 1> Let $p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_t$ the common prime divisors of $n$ and $a$, and let $\max_{1\le i\le t} v_{p_i} (n) =M$. Then, if we set $N=M$, the conclusion holds. Let $n=p_n \times q_n$, $a=p_a \times q_a$, where $p_n$ and $p_a$ represents the $p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_t$ part of the prime factorization of $n, a$, respectively. Note that $p_n | (p_1 p_2 \cdots p_t )^M$, and that $(a, q_n) =1$.

 First, if $k \geq M$, then $a^{k+\phi(n)} \equiv a^{k} \equiv 0\left(\bmod p_n \right)$. Also, $\phi(n)=\phi\left(p_n \right) \cdot \phi(q_n)$, so

 \[
 a^{k+\phi(n)} \equiv a^{k+\phi\left(p_n\right) \cdot \phi(q_n)} \equiv a^{k}(\bmod q_m)
 \]

 holds. Combining the two equations, we obtain $a^{k+\phi(n)} \equiv a^{k}(\bmod n)$, which completes the proof. $\qed$

 Let's also prove the following Lemma about $F_{n}$.

 <Lemma 2> Given positive integers $n$ and $a$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for any positive integer $k \geq N$, $F_{k} \equiv F_{k+\Phi(n)}(\bmod n)$ holds.

 Here, $\Phi(n)$ is the least common multiple of $n, \phi(n), \phi^{(2)}(n), \ldots$.

 <Proof of Lemma 2>

 We will prove this by induction on $n$.

 (1) (Base case) If $n=1$, the statement holds trivially.

 (2) (Induction step) Assume that the statement holds for all positive integers less than $n$.

 By the induction hypothesis, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for $k \geq N$,

 \[
 F_{k} \equiv F_{k+\Phi(\phi(n))}(\bmod \phi(n))
 \]

 holds.

 Now, consider the least common multiple of $\Phi(\phi(n))$ and $n$, which is $\Phi(n)$. Since $F_{k+1}=(k+1)^{F_{k}}$, by <Lemma $1>$,

 \[
 (k+\Phi(n)+1)^{F_{k+\Phi(n)}} \equiv(k+1)^{F_{k+\Phi(n)}} \equiv(k+1)^{F_{k}}(\bmod n)
 \]

 holds for all sufficiently large $k$. Therefore, the statement also holds for $n$. $\qed$

 Now, let's prove the original problem.
 <Step 1>$ \operatorname{gcd}(\Phi(\phi(c)), c)<c$

 <Step 1.1> Factorize $c$ into primes as $c=p_{1}^{e_{1}} \cdots p_{k}^{e_{k}}$. Also, let $p_{1}<\cdots<p_{k}, e_{i}>0$.

 <Step 1.2> Then, $\phi(c)=p_{1}^{e_{1}-1} \cdots p_{k}^{e_{k}-1}\left(p_{1}-1\right) \cdots\left(p_{k}-1\right)$, and since $p_{i}-1$ is not a multiple of $p_{k}$,

 \[
 v_{p_{k}}(\phi(c))<v_{p_{k}}(c)
 \]

 holds. Also, the largest prime factor of $\phi(c)$ is less than or equal to $p_{k}$.

 <Step 1.3> Therefore, by induction, for all positive integers $r$, $v_{p_{k}}\left(\phi^{(r)}(c)\right)<v_{p_{k}}(c)$ holds.

 <Step 2> Applying strong induction on $c$

 We will prove the problem by strong mathematical induction on $c$.

 <Step 2.1> If $c=1$, the statement holds for any positive integer $n$.

 <Step 2.2> Assume that the statement holds for $c=1, \ldots c-1$, and let's prove the statement for $c$.

 First, choose $n$ large enough so that

 \[
 a^{F_{n}} \equiv a^{F_n+\phi(c)}(\bmod c)
 \]

 holds. By <Step 1>, $\operatorname{gcd}(c, \Phi(\phi(c)))<c$, so by the induction hypothesis,

 \[
 a^{F_{n}}+n \equiv b(\bmod \operatorname{gcd}(c, \Phi(\phi(c)))
 \]

 has infinitely many solutions for $n$.

 <Step 2.3> By <Lemma 2>, among these solutions, for sufficiently large $n$,

 \[
 a^{F_{n}} \equiv a^{F_{n+\Phi(\phi(c))}}(\bmod c)
 \]

 holds. Let this $n$ be $n_{0}$.

 <Step 2.4> Consider the following system of congruences for $n$:

 \[
 n \equiv n_{0}(\bmod \Phi(\phi(c))), a^{F_{n_{0}}}+n \equiv b(\bmod c)
 \]

 This system of congruences has $n_{0}$ as a solution modulo $\operatorname{gcd}(c, \Phi(\phi(c)))$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists an $n$ that satisfies both congruences modulo $\operatorname{lcm}(\Phi(\phi(c)), c)$. For this $n$,

 \[
 a^{F_{n}}+n \equiv a^{F_{n_{0}}}+n \equiv b(\bmod c)
 \]

 holds, so the desired equation holds, and therefore the induction hypothesis holds for $c$.

 By induction, for all $c$, there exist infinitely many $n$ that satisfy $a^{F_{n}}+n \equiv b(\bmod c)$.","(Partial)

Let line $D N$ intersect the circumcircle of triangle $D K L$ again at point $P (\neq D)$. Let $Q (\neq C)$ be the second intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $O C P$ and line $B C$. Prove that $A B=A Q$. "," First, let $Z$ be the intersection of lines $E F$ and $B C$. From the harmonic relation $(Z D, B C)=-1$, we have $$D G \times D R=D H \times D A=D B \times D C=D Z \times D G,$$ which implies $D Z=D R$. Therefore $R S$ is the reflection of $E F$ with respect to $A H$. Now, let's invert the figure with respect to the circle centered at $D$ with radius $\sqrt{D B \times D C}$, and then reflect it across $A D$. Let the image of a point or figure $X$ after this transformation be denoted by $X^{\prime}$. It can be easily seen that $(A, H),(B, C),(Z, G),(E, F),(S, M)$ are pairs of corresponding points under this transformation. $I$ and $J$ are the intersections of $A G$ with $\odot(A D B)$ and $\odot(A D C)$ respectively, so $I^{\prime}=C H \cap \odot(D H Z)$ and $J^{\prime}=BH\cap \odot(D H Z)$. Also, $L=A G \cap \odot(D E F)$, so $L^{\prime}=\odot(D H Z) \cap E F$, which means $L'$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $H$ to $E F$. Let this point be $X$. Also, if we consider $A_{1}$, the reflection of $A$ across $G$, then $$A F \times A B=A H \times A D=2 A M \times A D=2 A L \times A G=A L \times A A_{1}$$ so $\left(B F L A_{1}\right)$ and $\left(C E L A_{1}\right)$ are sets of concyclic points. Therefore $A_{1}^{\prime}$ maps to $T \equiv \odot(C E X) \cap \odot(B F X)$. Meanwhile, since $A$ is the radical center of $\odot\left(B F L A_{1}\right), \odot\left(C E L A_{1}\right), \odot(B F E C)$, points $A, X, T$ are collinear. Furthermore, by the collinearity of $A, G, A_1$, $(H, Z, D, T)$ is a set of concyclic points.  Therefore, $$ \angle X T C=\angle A E F=\angle A H F=\angle E H X=\angle J^{\prime} H X=\angle J^{\prime} T X $$ so $J^{\prime}, T, C$ are collinear. For similar reasons, $\left(I^{\prime}, T, B\right)$ are also collinear. Therefore, by Pappus's theorem, $B F \cap C E=A, C J^{\prime} \cap B I^{\prime}=T, F J^{\prime} \cap E I^{\prime}=Y$ are collinear. At this point, $K$ is mapped to $Y$ by the transformation, so the four points $H, K, L, D$ are concyclic. $H, K, L, D, A_1, P$ all lie on this circle. Therefore, after the transformation (inversion then reflection), $A, T, Y, X, P^{\prime}$ are all collinear. Now, let $U$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $E F$, and let $V$ be the midpoint of $D U$. Then from the harmonic cross-ratio $$X(D U, V \infty)=(A H, S D)=-1$$ it can be seen that $V, X, A$ must be collinear. Therefore, $A, T, X, Y, V, P^{\prime}$ are all collinear. Therefore $V^{\prime}$ must lie on the circle passing through $H, K, L, D, A^{\prime}, P$. Since $V$ is the reflection of $O$ about $A H$, $D, O, V^{\prime}$ is collinear and so is $D, O, P$.

If this holds, let $Y$ be the intersection of $TP$ and $BC$. Then $YH \cdot YM = YT \cdot YP = YB \cdot YC$,
 which means that $Y$ is the point such that $(B, H, C, Y)$ is a harmonic division. This is a fixed point. Thus, $T$ lies on the inversion of $AC$ with respect to the circle centered at $Y$ with radius $\sqrt{YB \cdot YC}$. This is a fixed circle.

 \textbf{Claim:} $(B, T, P, C)$ are concyclic. This means that the circumcircles of $\triangle BPC$, $\triangle PHM$, and $\triangle KPQ$ are coaxial. We will use the following well-known Lemma: For two circles, the locus of points where the ratio of the powers with respect to the two circles is constant is a circle coaxial with the two circles.
 Now, using the Lemma, we see that it suffices to show that: The ratio of the powers of $B$ and $C$ with respect to the circumcircles of $\triangle PHM$ and $\triangle KPQ$ are the same.

 1) The ratio of powers of $B$ and $C$ with respect to the circumcircle of $\triangle PHM$ is $\frac{BH \cdot BM}{CH \cdot CM} = \frac{BH}{CH}$.

 2) Let's compute the ratio of powers of $B$ and $C$ with respect to the circumcircle of $\triangle KPQ$. Let $H_2$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $Q$ to $AC$, and let $L$ be the reflection of $A$ across $H_2$. Since $\angle QKP = \angle QLP = 180^\circ - \angle A$, $(K, L, P, Q)$ are concyclic. The power of $B$ is $BK \cdot BQ$, and the power of $C$ is $CL \cdot CP$. We want to show that $\frac{CL \cdot CP}{BK \cdot BQ} = \frac{CH}{BH}$.

 Let $D, E$ be the intersection of the Euler line of $\triangle ABC$ with $AB, AC$ respectively. Let $R$ be the intersection of $AX$ and $BC$.
 By Ceva's theorem, $\frac{CP}{BQ} = \frac{AP}{AQ} \times \frac{CR}{BR}$. $BK = BA - KA = BA - 2AP \cos A$, $CL = CA - LA = CA - 2AQ \cos A$.
 Thus $\frac{CL \cdot CP}{BK \cdot BQ} = \frac{CA - 2AQ \cos A}{BA - 2AP \cos A} \times \frac{AP}{AQ} \times \frac{CR}{BR} = \frac{\frac{CA}{AQ} - 2 \cos A}{\frac{BA}{AP} - 2 \cos A} \times \frac{CR}{BR}$.

 Let $\frac{XE}{DX} = \lambda$.
 $\frac{CR}{BR} = \frac{AC \sin \angle CAR}{AB \sin \angle BAR} = \frac{AC}{AB} \cdot \frac{AD}{AE} \cdot \frac{XE}{DX} = \frac{AC \cdot AD}{AB \cdot AE} \lambda$.
 By Menelaus' theorem on $\triangle ADE$ and line $CXQ$,
 $\frac{AQ}{QD} \cdot \frac{CE}{AC} \cdot \frac{DX}{EX} = 1$. Thus, $\frac{AQ}{QD} = \frac{AC}{CE} \lambda$, so $AQ = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{AC}{CE} \lambda} AD = \frac{AD}{1+\lambda \frac{AC}{CE}}.$
 Similarly, $AP = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{AB}{BD}} AE$.
 Thus $\frac{CL \cdot CP}{BK \cdot BQ} = \frac{\frac{CA}{AQ} - 2 \cos A}{\frac{BA}{AP} - 2 \cos A} \times \frac{CR}{BR}$ has the form $\frac{(\text{linear in } \lambda)}{(\text{linear in } \lambda)}$. That is, if it is $\frac{CH}{BH}$ for two values of $\lambda$, then it is $\frac{CH}{BH}$ for all $\lambda$.

 Case 1) $X = H$.
 In this case, $P, Q$ are the feet of the altitudes from $B, C$ respectively. Thus $KL \parallel BC$. Thus $\frac{CL \cdot CP}{BK \cdot BQ} = \frac{CH \cdot CB}{BH \cdot BC} = \frac{CH}{BH}$.

 Case 2) $X = G$.
 In this case, $P, Q$ are the midpoints of $AC, AB$, and $K, L$ are the feet of altitudes from $C, B$ respectively. Thus $\frac{CL \cdot CP}{BK \cdot BQ} = \frac{CH \cdot \frac{CB}{2}}{BH \cdot \frac{BC}{2}} = \frac{CH}{BH}$.
 Since $H \neq G$ due to scalene condition, we have two different values of $\lambda$, completing the proof.","(Partial)

 <Lemma 1> If $a, b, c$ are positive integers with $ab \neq 0$ satisfying $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, then there exist positive integers $m \neq n$ and $k$ such that

 \[
 (a, b, c)=k\left(2 m n, m^{2}-n^{2}, m^{2}+n^{2}\right) \text { or } k\left(m^{2}-n^{2}, 2 m n, m^{2}+n^{2}\right).
 \]

 In particular, if $a, b$ are relatively prime, then $k=1$ and $m$ and $n$ have different parity, and one of $a, b$ is odd and the other is even. The odd one is expressed as $m^{2}-n^{2}$ and the even one is expressed as $2mn$. Also, in this case, $c$ is always odd.
 <Proof of Lemma 1> Omitted. \qed
 <Lemma 2> If $p$ is a prime number or 1, and positive integers $x$ and relatively prime positive integers $a, b$ satisfy

 \[
 p a b=x^{2},
 \]

 then there exist positive integers $u, v$ such that $(a, b, x)=\left(p u^{2}, v^{2}, p u v\right)$ or $\left(u^{2}, p v^{2}, p u v\right)$.
 <Proof of Lemma 2> Omitted. \qed

 <Lemma 3> If $a^{2}+b^{2}$ is a multiple of 4 for integers $a, b$, then both $a$ and $b$ are even.

 <Proof of Lemma 3> $a$ and $b$ must have the same parity, but the square of an odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so if $a, b$ have the same parity as odd numbers, then $a^{2}+b^{2}$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, so it cannot be a multiple of 4. \qed

 Now, let's proceed with the proof of the main problem using these facts.
 <Step 1> There are no positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x^{4}+y^{4}=z^{2}$. Therefore, $n$ is odd.

 <Step 1.1> Using proof by contradiction, assume that there exists a positive integer solution $x, y, z$. Among these solutions, choose the solution $(x, y, z)$ with the smallest $z$. If there is a prime number $q$ that divides two of $x, y, z$, then it must also divide the remaining number, and in this case, $\left(\frac{x}{q}, \frac{y}{q}, \frac{z}{q^{2}}\right)$ becomes a solution, contradicting the minimality of $z$. Therefore, this solution is pairwise relatively prime.

 <Step 1.2> Since $\left(x^{2}, y^{2}, z\right)$ is a Pythagorean triple, by <Lemma 1>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ with different parity such that


 \begin{equation*}
 x^{2}=u^{2}-v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v, z=u^{2}+v^{2} \tag{1.1}
 \end{equation*}


 We can assume that $u > v$ without loss of generality. Since $y^{2}=2 u v$ and $u, v$ are relatively prime, by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $s, t$ such that $u=2 s^{2}, v=t^{2}$ or $u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2}$.

 (Case 1) $u=2 s^{2}, v=t^{2}$

 $x^{2}+t^{4}=4 s^{4}$. By <Lemma 3>, both $x$ and $t$ must be even, but from $x^{2}=u^{2}-v^{2}$, $x$ is odd, which is a contradiction.

 (Case 2) $u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2}$

 $x^{2}+4 t^{4}=s^{4}$ and since $t|v, v| y^{2}$,

 \[
 \operatorname{gcd}(x, t)|\operatorname{gcd}(x, v)| \operatorname{gcd}\left(x, y^{2}\right)=1.
 \]

 Therefore, $x$ and $t^{2}$ are also relatively prime, and by <Lemma 1>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $q, r$ with different parity (since $x$ is odd by (1.1)) such that

 \[
 x=q^{2}-r^{2}, 2 t^{2}=2 q r, s^{2}=q^{2}+r^{2}.
 \]

 Since $t^{2}=q r$, by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $x', y'$ such that $q=x^{\prime 2}, r=y^{\prime 2}$, and thus by the above equation, $x^{\prime 4}+y^{\prime 4}=s^{2}$. Since

 \[
 s=\sqrt{u} \leq u<u^{2}+v^{2}=z,
 \]

 this contradicts the minimality of $(x, y, z)$. Therefore, the proof is complete.

 <Step 2> If $p^{3}=a^{4}+b^{4}$, then there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ such that $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 <Step 2.1> If $p \mid a$, then clearly $p \mid b$ must also hold, and vice versa. Therefore, $a, b$ are either both multiples of $p$ or not. However, if the former is the case, the right-hand side becomes a multiple of $p^{4}$, which is a contradiction, so $p$ is relatively prime to both $a$ and $b$.

 <Step 2.2> Therefore, $p$ is a divisor of the sum of squares, and since $(p, a)=(p, b)=1$, $p$ is a prime number of the form $4 k+1$, so it can be expressed in the form $p=c^{2}+d^{2}$. By Jacobi's theorem, there are only two ways (considering order) to express $p^{3}$ as the sum of perfect squares:

 \[
 (p c)^{2}+(p d)^{2} \text { and } \left(c\left(c^{2}-3 d^{2}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(d\left(3 c^{2}-d^{2}\right)\right)^{2}.
 \]

 By (1), the first case cannot be expressed as $a^{4}+b^{4}$, so

 \[
 a^{2}=\left|c\left(c^{2}-3 d^{2}\right)\right|, \quad b^{2}=\left|d\left(3 c^{2}-d^{2}\right)\right|
 \]

 (or vice versa, but we can ignore this case due to symmetry) must hold. Letting $C=|c|, D=|d|$, we have


 \begin{equation*}
 a^{2} b^{2}=C D \times\left|C^{2}-3 D^{2}\right| \times\left|3 C^{2}-D^{2}\right| \tag{1.2}
 \end{equation*}


 and $\operatorname{gcd}(C, D)=1$. Now, we divide into cases depending on whether $C D$ is a multiple of 3.

 (Case 1) If $3 \mid C D$

 Without loss of generality, assume $3 \mid C$. Then, from

 \[
 \left(\frac{a b}{3}\right)^{2}=\frac{C}{3} \cdot D \cdot\left|3\left(\frac{C}{3}\right)^{2}-D^{2}\right| \cdot\left|3 C^{2}-D^{2}\right|,
 \]

 since the four terms are pairwise relatively prime, there exist positive integers $e, f, g, h$ such that

 \[
 C=3 e^{2}, \quad D=f^{2},\left|3 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=g^{2},\left|27 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=h^{2}.
 \]

 Then, by $\bmod 3$, we have $g^{2}+3 e^{4}=f^{4}$.

 (Case 2) If $3 \nmid CD$

 From (1.2), since the four terms are pairwise relatively prime, there exist positive integers $e, f, g, h$ such that

 \[
 C=e^{2}, \quad D=f^{2},\left|e^{4}-3 f^{4}\right|=g^{2},\left|3 e^{4}-f^{4}\right|=h^{2}.
 \]

 Similarly, by $\bmod 3$, we have $e^{4}-3 f^{4}=g^{2}$.

 Therefore, in both cases, there exists a positive integer solution to $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 <Step 3> There are no positive integers $x, y, z$ satisfying $x^{2}+3 y^{4}=z^{4}$.

 Using proof by contradiction, assume that there exists a positive integer solution $x, y, z$. Among these solutions, choose the solution $(x, y, z)$ with the smallest $z$. If there is a prime number $q$ that divides two of $x, y, z$, then it must also divide the remaining number, and in this case, $\left(\frac{x}{q^{2}}, \frac{y}{q}, \frac{z}{q}\right)$ becomes a solution, contradicting the minimality of $z$. Therefore, this solution is pairwise relatively prime.

 Now, rewriting the equation as


 \begin{equation*}
 3 y^{4}=\left(z^{2}-x\right)\left(z^{2}+x\right) \tag{1.3}
 \end{equation*}


 we can divide into two cases since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(z^{2}-x, z^{2}+x\right)=1$ or 2.

 (Case 1) If $x$ and $z$ have the same parity

 By <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ such that

 \[
 z^{2}-x=2 u^{2}, z^{2}+x=6 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v \quad \text { or } \quad z^{2}+x=2 u^{2}, z^{2}-x=6 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v.
 \]

 In both cases, we have


 \begin{equation*}
 z^{2}=u^{2}+3 v^{2}, y^{2}=2 u v. \tag{1.4}
 \end{equation*}


 Since $y$ is even, one of $u, v$ must be even.

 <Step 3.1> If $u$ is even, then $v$ is odd, and then $z^{2}=u^{2}+3 v^{2} \equiv 3(\bmod 4)$, which is a contradiction.

 <Step 3.2> If $v$ is even, then by <Lemma 2>, there exist positive integers $s, t$ such that

 \[
 u=s^{2}, v=2 t^{2},
 \]

 and substituting this back into (1.4) gives $s^{4}+12 t^{4}=z^{2}$. Since both $s$ and $z$ are odd, this equation can be written as

 \[
 \frac{z+s^{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=3 t^{4},
 \]

 and since $\operatorname{gcd}\left(\frac{z+s^{2}}{2}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}\right)=1$, by <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $q, r$ such that

 \[
 \frac{z+s^{2}}{2}=q^{4}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=3 r^{4} \quad \text { or } \quad \frac{z+s^{2}}{2}=3 r^{4}, \frac{z-s^{2}}{2}=q^{4}.
 \]

 In the second case, we have $s^{2}=3 r^{4}-q^{4}$, but since $q$ and $s$ cannot both be multiples of 3 (in this case, $r$ would also be a multiple of 3, leading to a contradiction), $s^{2}+q^{4}$ cannot be a multiple of 3, which is a contradiction. In the remaining case, we have $s^{2}=q^{4}-3 r^{4}$, but since $q \leq q^{4} = \frac{z+s^2}{2} < z$, this contradicts the minimality of $z$.

 (Case 2) If $x$ and $z$ have different parity

 In this case, by (1.3) and <Lemma 2>, there exist relatively prime positive integers $u, v$ such that

 \[
 z^{2}+x=u^{4}, z^{2}-x=3 v^{4}, y^{2}=u v \quad \text { or } \quad z^{2}-x=3 v^{4}, z^{2}+x=u^{4}, y^{2}=u v.
 \]

 In both cases, we have $2 z^{2}=u^{4}+3 v^{4}$, but since $z$ and $u$ cannot both be multiples of 3, this leads to a contradiction modulo 3.

 Therefore, by <Step 1>, $n \neq 2,4$, and by <Step 2>, $n \neq 3$, so the proof is complete.","(Partial)

 <Lemma> For positive real numbers $x, y$ satisfying $xy \geq 1$, the following inequality holds:

 \[
 \frac{1}{1+x}+\frac{1}{1+y} \geq \frac{2}{1+\sqrt{x y}}
 \]

 <Proof of Lemma> The proof is a simple calculation. Multiplying both sides by $(1+\sqrt{x y})(1+x)(1+y)$, the given inequality simplifies to $(\sqrt{x y}-1)(\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y})^{2} \geq 0$, which holds trivially under the condition $x y \geq 1$. Therefore, the inequality is proven.\qed

 Now, let's prove the main problem. We will prove by induction that the following inequality holds for each $k=n, n-1, \cdots, 1$:

 \begin{equation*}
 \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{b_{n}}+\frac{1}{b_{n-1}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{b_{k}} \geq \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \frac{1}{1+\left(a_{n} a_{n-1} \cdots a_{k}\right)^{2^{k-1}}} \tag{1.1}
 \end{equation*}

 In particular, if this inequality holds for $k=1$, then the inequality in the problem is proven due to the condition $a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}=1$.
 <Step 1> First, for $k=n$, since $a_{n} \geq 1$, we obtain the following by <Lemma>:

 \[
 \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{b_{n}}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\left(\frac{1}{1+1}+\frac{1}{1+a_{n}^{2^{n}}}\right) \geq \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \frac{1}{1+a_{n}^{2^{n-1}}}
 \]

 Therefore, (1.1) holds.

 <Step 2> Next, let's prove that if (1.1) holds for $k=m$, then it also holds for $k=m-1$ (where $2 \leq m \leq n$).

 <Step 2.1> First, by the induction hypothesis, we obtain the following inequality:

 \[
 \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{b_{n}}+\frac{1}{b_{n-1}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{b_{m}}+\frac{1}{b_{m-1}} \geq \frac{1}{2^{m-1}}\left[\frac{1}{1+\left(a_{n} a_{n-1} \cdots a_{m}\right)^{2^{m-1}}}+\frac{1}{1+a_{m-1}^{2_{m-1}^{m}}}\right]
 \]

 <Step 2.2> By the condition of the problem,

 \[
 \left(a_{n} a_{n-1} \cdots a_{m}\right)^{2^{m-1}} \cdot a_{m-1}^{2^{m-1}} \geq 1
 \]

 Therefore, by <Lemma>,

 \[
 \frac{1}{2^{m-1}}\left[\frac{1}{1+\left(a_{n} a_{n-1} \cdots a_{m}\right)^{2^{m-1}}}+\frac{1}{1+a_{m-1}^{2^{m-1}}}\right] \geq \frac{1}{2^{m-2}} \frac{1}{1+\left(a_{n} a_{n-1} \cdots a_{m} a_{m-1}\right)^{2^{m-2}}}
 \]

 This confirms that inequality (1.1) also holds for $k=m-1$.

At each step, you must choose one of the two operations — either adding 2 or multiplying by 3 — for each number separately, and apply the chosen operation to both numbers (possibly using different operations). You must apply an operation to both numbers every step. Find all pairs $(a, b)$ such that we can make the two numbers on the blackboard equal after a finite number of steps.","The answer is that $a$ and $b$ are both even, or $a$ and $b$ are both odd and have the same remainder when divided by 4.
 <Step 1> Finding an invariant

 Let's observe how the remainder when divided by 4 changes under the operations. First, for odd numbers, both operations change the remainder as follows:

 $1 \rightarrow 3,3 \rightarrow 1$

 For even numbers, adding 2 changes the remainder as follows:

 \[
 0 \rightarrow 2,2 \rightarrow 0
 \]

 and multiplying by 3 changes the remainder as follows:
 \[
 0 \rightarrow 0,2 \rightarrow 2
 \]


 <Step 2> Finding impossible cases

 <Step 2.1> From the observation in <Step 1>, we can find conditions on $a$ and $b$ for which the conclusion of the problem does not hold. Let's consider the following two cases:

 <Step 2.2> (Case 1) $a$ and $b$ have different parity.

 Since the parity of the two numbers does not change under the operations, the two numbers cannot become equal. Therefore, the answer is impossible in this case.

 <Step 2.3> (Case 2) $a$ and $b$ are both odd and have different remainders when divided by 4.

 Since odd numbers change their remainders when divided by 4 under each operation, the remainders of the two numbers when divided by 4 will always be different, regardless of the operations. Therefore, the answer is impossible in this case.

 Now, let's prove that the answer is possible for $a$ and $b$ that do not satisfy (Case 1) and (Case 2).

 <Step 3> Showing that the operations exist for the remaining cases.

 <Step 3.1> The remaining cases are as follows:

 (Case 3) $a, b$ are both odd and have the same remainder when divided by 4.

 (Case 4) $a, b$ are both even.

 <Step 3.2> First, let's show that we can make $a \equiv b(\bmod 4)$ for both cases by applying operations to $a$ and $b$. In (Case 3), $a \equiv b(\bmod 4)$ is already satisfied.

 In (Case 4), if $a \neq b(\bmod 4)$, then by applying the operation of changing $a$ to $3a$ and $b$ to $b+2$, we can see that $3a \equiv b+2(\bmod 4)$. Therefore, we can make the two numbers congruent modulo 4.

 <Step 3.3> Now, let's write the two numbers with the same remainder when divided by 4 as $x$ and $x+4n$. Let's add 2 to $x$ for $k$ times and then multiply it by 3. On the other hand, let's multiply $x+4n$ by 3 and then add 2 to it for $k$ times. As a result of the operations, $x$ becomes $3(x+2k)$ and $x+4n$ becomes $3x+12n+2k$.

 Therefore, if we set $k=3n$, then the two numbers become equal.

 <Step 1> The circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$, the circumcircle of $\triangle A V W$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle A E F$ meet at a point $P$ other than $A$.

 (1) Let $P(\neq A)$ be the intersection of the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$ and the circumcircle of $\triangle A E F$. Then, $\triangle P E C \sim \triangle P F B(A A)$.

 (2) From the perspective of $\triangle A E F$, the incircle is the excircle, and since $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle A E F$, we have $\frac{F W}{E V}=\frac{B W}{C V}$.

 (3) Therefore, $\frac{B W}{F W}=\frac{C V}{E V}$, so $\triangle P E V \sim \triangle P F W(S A S)$, and by the inscribed angle theorem, we know that $A, V, W, P$ must lie on a circle.


 <Step 2> Using radical axis

 (1) By considering the radical axis of the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$, the circumcircle of $\triangle A E F$, and $(E, F, B, C)$, we see that $E F, A P, B C$ must be concurrent. Let this point be $R$.

 (2) By considering the radical axis of the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$, the circumcircle of $\triangle I B C$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle A V W$, we see that $I R$ must be tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle I B C$.


 <Step 3> $Q$ is the point of tangency between the $A$-inmixtilinear circle of $\triangle A B C$ and the circumcircle.

 (1) $B, H_{0}, C, R$ are harmonic conjugates, so for the midpoint $M$ of $B C, R M \times R H_{0}=R B \times R C$. This is equal to $R I^{2}$ since $R I$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle I B C$.

 (2) Therefore, $I H_{0}$ is the symmedian of $\triangle I B C$.

 (3) Therefore, $Q$ must be the point of tangency between the $A$-inmixtilinear circle of $\triangle A B C$ and the circumcircle.


 <Step 4> $V, H, W$ are collinear and $H V$ bisects $\angle E H C$.

 Since $\frac{H E}{H C}=\frac{E F}{B C}=\frac{E V}{C V}$(because $\triangle A B C \sim \triangle A E F$) $H V$ bisects $\angle E H C$. Similarly, $H W$ bisects $\angle F H B$, and therefore $V, H, W$ are collinear.


 <Step 5> $K$ is the reflection of $D$ with respect to $M$.

 (1) Since $\frac{H B}{H C}=\frac{B W}{C V}=\frac{B D}{C D}, H D$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B H C$, and therefore $H D$ is perpendicular to $V W$. That is, $H D$ is parallel to $A I$.

 (2) Therefore, quadrilateral $A I D H$ is a parallelogram, and $A H=I D$. Therefore, $O M$ is half the length of the inradius. Therefore, $K$ is the reflection of $D$ with respect to $M$.


 <Step 6> Finishing the proof

 (1) Let $l$ be the perpendicular bisector of $B C$.

 (2) By Step $3$, $X$ is the reflection of $A$ with respect to $l$.

 (3) By Step $5$ $K$ is the reflection of $D$ with respect to $l$.

 (4) Therefore, the intersection $Y$ of $X K$ and the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$ is the reflection of the intersection of $A D$ and the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$ with respect to $l$. This holds because this is the point of tangency between the $A$-exmixtilinear circle and the circumcircle of $\triangle A B C$.

Define $c$ such that when the expression $\left(d+\frac{n}{d}\right)^{2}$ is divided by $n$, the remainder is $n-c$.

What is the smallest possible value of $c$ among all $d$ and $n$ satisfying the conditions above?

(Note that the remainder when a positive integer $a$ is divided by a positive integer $b$ is the value of $r$ in the expression $a=b q+r, 0 \leq r \leq b-1$.)","<Step 1> Understanding the problem situation

 <Step 1.1> Let $d=a, \frac{n}{d}=b$, then $n=a b$. So if the remainder when $(a+b)^{2}$ is divided by $n$ is $n-c$ (where $c \geq 1$), then

 \[
 -c \equiv(a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+2 a b \equiv a^{2}+b^{2}(\bmod n)
 \]

 which implies that $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ must be a positive integer.

 <Step 1.2> First, if $c=3$, then setting $a=4, b=19$ gives

 \[
 \frac{4^{2}+19^{2}+3}{4 \cdot 19}=5
 \]

 which is an integer. In fact, this corresponds to the case when $n=76, d=4$, and $\left(4+\frac{76}{4}\right)^{2}=529 \equiv -3(\bmod 76)$.

 <Step 1.3> Therefore, if $c \leq 2$, it is sufficient to prove that when $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ is a positive integer, $n$ cannot have remainder 6 when divided by $7$. Now, let's assume that $c$ is 1 or 2.

 <Step 2> Vieta jumping

 <Step 2.1> First, let's find the solutions when $a=b$. Then $\frac{2 a^{2}+c}{a^{2}}$ must be a positive integer, so $a^{2} \mid c$. Since $c$ is 1 or 2, we know that $a=1$. Therefore, $(a, b)=(1,1)$ is the only solution in this case. Now, let's find the solutions when $a \neq b$. By symmetry, we can assume $a<b$, so let's find all such pairs $(a, b)$.

 <Step 2.2> We need to find pairs $(a, b)$ that satisfy the following for some positive integer $k$:


 \begin{equation*}
 \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}=k \tag{1.1}
 \end{equation*}


 The above equation (1.1) can be rewritten as:

 \[
 a^{2}-k a b+b^{2}+c=0
 \]

 Now, if we view this equation as a quadratic equation in $b$, we can observe the following facts from the relationship between roots and coefficients:

 (1) The sum of the two roots is $k a$, so if a positive integer $b$ is a root, then the other root is $k a-b$, which is also an integer.

 (2) The product of the two roots is $a^{2}+c$, so if a positive integer $b$ is a root, then $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}$ is also a root, and by (1), it is a positive integer solution.

 (2) Therefore, if $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1), then


 \begin{equation*}
 \left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=\left(\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}, a\right)=(k a-b, a) \tag{1.2}
 \end{equation*}


 defined as above is also a solution to (1.1).

 This process gives us a way to find another solution if we have a solution $(a, b)$.

 <Step 3> Applying the method of infinite descent

 Suppose $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1) with $a<b$. Now, let's apply infinite descent to the recursive construction process of solutions described in <Step 2> .

 <Step 3.1> Since we assumed $a<b$,

 \[
 b^{2} \geq(a+1)^{2}>a^{2}+2 \geq a^{2}+c
 \]

 so $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}<b$. In other words, from (1.2),

 \[
 a^{\prime}+b^{\prime}=\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}+a<a+b
 \]

 holds. That is, when performing the recursive construction in <Step 1>, the sum of the two numbers forming the solution always decreases by at least 1.

 <Step 3.2> If $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}<a$, we can apply the process in <Step 1> again to the new solution $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=\left(\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}, a\right)$ to obtain another solution. However, by the result in (1) and the principle of infinite descent, this process cannot be repeated infinitely, and we will eventually reach a solution $(a, b)$ that satisfies $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b} \geq a$.

 <Step 3.3> Let's find what the final solution we must reach in (2) is. If $a<b$, then $b \geq a+1$ must hold. In this situation, if $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b} \geq a$, then

 \[
 a^{2}+c \geq a b \geq a(a+1)=a^{2}+a
 \]

 so $a \leq c$ must hold. Since $a$ is a positive integer, only $a=1,2$ are possible. Here, if $a=2$, then all equalities in the above inequality must hold, so $b=a+1=3$ and $c=2$, which gives

 \[
 \frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}=\frac{2^{2}+3^{2}+3}{2 \cdot 3}=\frac{8}{3}
 \]

 which is not an integer. Therefore, $a$ must be 1 in any case, and $\frac{a^{2}+c}{b}=\frac{1+c}{b}$ must be an integer.$b>a$ and $c+1=2or3$ so $b=c+1$.

 Therefore, this process ends when $(1, c+1)$ becomes $\left(\frac{1^{2}+c}{c+1}, 1\right)=(1,1)$.

 <Step 3.4> Summarizing the above discussion, if $(a, b)$ is a solution to (1.1) with $a<b$, then $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)$ obtained in <Step 1> is a new solution satisfying $a^{\prime}<b^{\prime}$, and this process of generating solutions ends when the solution reaches $(1,1)$.

 <Step 4> Reversing the descent process

 <Step 4.1> First, the value of $k$ in (1.1) does not change during the process described in <Step 3> . Therefore, the value of $k$ must be the same as the value at the endpoint $(a, b)=(1,1)$ of this process, so

 \[
 k=\frac{1^{2}+1^{2}+1}{c \cdot 1}=c+2
 \]

 must hold.

 <Step 4.2> Now, we know that any solution $(a, b)$ to (1.1) with $a<b$ reaches the endpoint $(a, b)=(1,1)$ by going through the process described in <Step 3> . Therefore, by reversing this process, we can find all solutions $(a, b)$ to (1.1) with $a<b$.

 <Step 4.3> On the other hand, from (1), $k=c+2$, so looking at (1.2), we see that $\left(a^{\prime}, b^{\prime}\right)=((c+2) a-b, a)$. Therefore,

 \[
 (a, b)=\left(b^{\prime},(c+2) b^{\prime}-a^{\prime}\right)
 \]

 holds. In other words, the process of mapping $(x, y) \mapsto(y,(c+2) y-x)$ is the reverse of the process where the solution descends in <Step 2> .

 <Step 4.4> Therefore, by (3), if we define the sequence $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ as $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(1,1)$ and

 \begin{equation} \tag{1.3}
 \left\{\begin{array}{l}
 x_{n+1}=y_{n}

 y_{n+1}=(c+2) y_{n}-x_{n}
 \end{array}\right.
 \end{equation}

 then this sequence describes the reverse of the process where the solution descends in <Step 2>, and by (2), these $\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\right)$ with $n \geq 2$ are all solutions to (1.1) with $a<b$.

 Note that the descent process described in <Step 2> is

 \[
 \left(x_{k}, y_{k}\right) \rightarrow\left(x_{k-1}, y_{k-1}\right) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)=(1,1)
 \]

 <Step 4.5>

 (Case 1) When $c=1$, substituting the first equation of (1.3) into the second equation gives the recurrence relation

 \[
 y_{n+1}=3 y_{n}-y_{n-1}
 \]

 and using $y_{1}=1, y_{2}=2$, we can see that this sequence repeats as $1,2,5,6,6,5,2,1,1,2$ modulo 7. Therefore, $x_n y_{n} = y_n y_{n-1}$ repeats as $2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1$ and thus cannot have remainder 6 when devided by $7$.

 (Case 2) When $c=2$, substituting the first equation of (1.3) into the second equation gives the recurrence relation

 \[
 y_{n+1}=4 y_{n}-y_{n-1}
 \]

 and using $y_{1}=1, y_{2}=3$, we can see that this sequence repeats as $1,3,4,6,6,4,3,1,1,3$ modulo 7. Therefore, $x_n y_{n} = y_n y_{n-1}$ repeats as $3,5,3,1,3,5,3,1$ and thus cannot have remainder 6 when divided by $7$.

 In conclusion, when $c=1,2$, there is no case where $ab$ has remainder $6$ when divided by $7$ and $\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}+c}{a b}$ is an integer. Therefore, $c=3$ is the smallest possible value.","(Partial)

If $q$ is the largest integer which is not larger than $\frac{n^2}{k}$, then, each of the $k$ colors must be used to color exactly $q$ or $q+1$ cells. A sequence of $n$ different cells $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ in the grid is called a \textit{snake} if it satisfies the following conditions simultaneously:

 \item[(b)] For each $1 \le i \le n-1$, cell $c_i$ and cell $c_{i+1}$ are colored with different colors.

 \[

 \]","Let $(i, j)$ denote the cell in the $i$-th column from the left and the $j$-th row from the bottom.


 <Step 1> For any $n \geq 5$, we can color the grid with $q=3$ and $r:= n^2 - kq \leq n+\lceil 2 \sqrt{n}\rceil+2$ so that it does not satisfy the conditions. From this, we can see that $a(n) \geq \frac{n^{2}- (n+2 \sqrt{n}+3)}{3}$.


 (1) Let $m=\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil-1$.


 (2) For the following cells, color the $2 \times 2$ square with that cell as its bottom left corner with the same color.

 \[
 \{(i, j): i, j \in \mathbb{Z}, m|i, \quad m| j, \quad 1 \leq i, j \leq n-1\}
 \]

 Color each $2 \times 2$ square with a different color. Let $A$ be the area colored in this way.


 (3) In the remaining area excluding $A$, we can color the cells so that each color is used 3 times. For any $i$ such that $m \mid i$, color the cells $(x, y)$ with $x=i$ that do not belong to $A$ with the same color as the cell above it, and color the cells $(x, y)$ with $y=i$ that do not belong to $A$ with the same color as the cell to its right. Color the remaining cells arbitrarily, but make sure that each color appears 3 or 4 times.


 (4) Since we can do this with $k=\left\lfloor\frac{n^{2}-|A|}{3}\right\rfloor, r \leq|A|+2$.


 (5) From this,
 \[
 |A|=\left\lfloor\frac{n-1}{m}\right\rfloor^{2}<\left(\frac{n-1}{\sqrt{n}-1}\right)^{2}<n+2 \sqrt{n}+1
 \]
 and $r \leq n+\lceil 2 \sqrt{n}\rceil+2$ holds.


 (6) Show that for this arrangement, there do not exist $n$ cells that satisfy the conditions. Group the cells into $m \times m$ squares starting from the bottom left of the grid. Treat any remaining cells at the top or right as if the grid were extended and group them in the same way. Each grouped section contains at most $m^{2}$ cells.


 (7) In order to start from within a grouped section and exit it, one must pass through consecutive cells of the same color due to the construction in (3) and (4). Therefore, $n \leq m^{2}$ must hold. This contradicts the definition of $m$. That is, this coloring does not satisfy the conditions.


 <Step 2> If $k \geq \frac{n^{2}}{3}$, the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, $a(n) \leq\left\lceil\frac{n^{2}}{3}\right\rceil \leq \frac{n^{2}+2}{3}$.


 (1) Consider the following graph: each cell is a vertex, and each cell is connected to the vertices of cells adjacent to it that have a different color.


 (2) Consider the $4 n-4$ cells on the border of the given $n \times n$ grid. Now, let's prove the following claim.

 Claim. For any two vertices $x, y$ belonging to the same connected component $\Phi$ on the border, if there is no vertex in $\Phi$ when moving clockwise along the border from $x$ to $y$, then the vertex one step clockwise from $x$ and the vertex one step counterclockwise from $y$ belong to the same connected component.


 (3) Let $z$ be the vertex one step clockwise from $x$ and $w$ be the vertex one step counterclockwise from $y$. Consider the boundary of the polygon formed by the cells in $\Phi$. This boundary consists of the perimeter edges of the given $n \times n$ grid or the edges shared by two adjacent cells within the $n \times n$ grid. The edge $l$ shared by $x$ and $z$ and the edge $m$ shared by $y$ and $w$ are both included in the boundary of this polygon. By the condition, on the boundary of this polygon, the line segments between $l$ and $m$ are all inside the $n \times n$ grid.


 (4) Let these line segments between $l$ and $m$ be $a_{0}, a_{1}, \cdots, a_{k}$ in order ( $a_{0}=l, a_{k}=m$ ). Each $a_{i}$ lies on the boundary between a cell belonging to $\Phi$ and a cell not belonging to $\Phi$. That is, the two cells sharing $a_{i}$ must have the same color. We will show that the cells not belonging to $\Phi$ that share $a_{i}$ all belong to the same connected component. We will use induction to show that for $i=0, \cdots, s$, the cells not belonging to $\Phi$ that share $a_{i}$ all belong to the same connected component.


 (5) Now, if $s=0$, it is trivial since there is only one cell. Therefore, using the inductive hypothesis, assume that the statement holds for $s-1$ and consider the case for $s$.


 (Case 1) If $a_{s-1}$ and $a_{s}$ lie on the same line

 This is the case where for some $2 \times 2$ square and the line connecting the midpoints of two opposite sides, one side belongs to $\Phi$ and the opposite side does not. In this case, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to this line. Therefore, the two cells not belonging to $\Phi$ must also be connected by a line segment.


 (Case 2) If $a_{s-1}$ and $a_{s}$ form a $90^{\circ}$ angle

 This means that for some $2 \times 2$ square, the two lines connecting its center to the midpoints of two consecutive sides are $a_{s-1}$ and $a_{s}$. These lines divide the $2 \times 2$ square into 1 cell and 3 cells. Place the centers of these cells on a new coordinate plane. Suppose they are divided into $(0,0)$ and $(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)$. Then $(0,0)$ and $(1,0),(0,1)$ must have the same color. Since each color is used at most 3 times, these are different from the color of $(1,1)$. Therefore, $(1,1)$ is connected to $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. That is, both sides of the division belong to the same connected component.


 (6) Therefore, by mathematical induction, all cells not belonging to $\Phi$ that share $a_{i}$ are in the same connected component. This means that $z$ and $w$ are in the same connected component. This completes the proof of the Claim.


 (7) Returning to the main proof, we will consider the vertices on the border. For two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, define the 'grid distance' as $|x_1 -x_2| +|y_1 - y_2|$. Let points $a$ and $b$ be the pair of points on the boarder that have the largest grid distance between them while being on the same connected component.

(8) If the grid distance between $a$ and $b$ is larger or equal to $n-1$, then the path on the connected component that connects $a$ and $b$ is a desired \textit{snake} and we are done.

(9) If the grid distance is smaller than $n-1$, then let the squares one step clockwise from $a$ and $b$ be $a_1$ and $b_1$, respectively, and the squares one step counterclockwise from $a$ and $b$ be  $a_2$ and $b_2$, respectively. Now without loss of generality, we can say the grid distance between $a_1$ and $b_2$ is smaller than $n-1$. Now think of the path along the boundary connecting $a_2$ and $b_1$, not passing $a$ and $b$. The length of this path is at least $4n-4 -(n-1)-2 = 3n-5$, so if there is a square $c$ that is in the same connected component with $a$ and $b$, the grid distance between $(a,c)$ or $(b,c)$ is larger than $n-1$, thus a contradiction to maximality. However, if there are no squares in the path from $a_2$ to $b_1$ , by Claim $a_2$ and $b_1$ must be in the same connected component, which is agian a contradiction to the maximality of $(a,b)$.","(Partial)

 Find all positive real numbers $r$ such that $n(n+1)r - B(n,r)$ is a multiple of $n$ for all positive integers $n$.","Let $r$ be a positive real number. Let $A(r)$ denote the fractional part of $2r$, so $A(r) = 2r - \lfloor 2r \rfloor$. We are given that $B(n,r) = \sum_{k=1}^n A(kr)$. We want to find all positive real numbers $r$ such that $n(n+1)r - B(n,r)$ is a multiple of $n$ for all positive integers $n$.

 We can rewrite the condition as
 $$
 n(n+1)r - \sum_{k=1}^n (2kr - \lfloor 2kr \rfloor) = \sum_{k=1}^n \lfloor 2kr \rfloor \quad \text{is a multiple of } n.
 $$
 Let $\alpha = 2r$. Then the condition becomes: $\sum_{k=1}^n \lfloor k\alpha \rfloor$ is a multiple of $n$ for all positive integers $n$.

 We prove that all even integers $\alpha$ satisfy the condition, and no other real number $\alpha$ does so. First we will show that
 even integers satisfy the condition. If $\alpha=2m$ where $m$ is
 an integer then

 \[
 \lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\lfloor2\alpha\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor=2m+4m+\cdots+2mn=mn(n+1)
 \]

 which is a multiple of $n$. Since $r > 0$, we must have $\alpha = 2r > 0$. So $\alpha$ must be a positive even integer. If $\alpha = 2m$ for some positive integer $m$, then $r = m$, which is a positive integer.

 Now we will show that they are the only real numbers satisfying the
 conditions of the problem. Let $\alpha=k+\epsilon$ where $k$ is
 an integer and $0\leqslant\epsilon<1$. Then the number
 \[
 \begin{aligned}\lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\lfloor2\alpha\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor & = \lfloor k+\epsilon \rfloor+\lfloor2(k+\epsilon)\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n(k+\epsilon)\rfloor

 & = k+\lfloor\epsilon\rfloor+2k+\lfloor2\epsilon\rfloor+\cdots+nk+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor

 & =\frac{kn(n+1)}{2}+\lfloor\epsilon\rfloor+\lfloor2\epsilon\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor
 \end{aligned}
 \]
 has to be a multiple of $n$. We consider two cases based on the parity
 of $k$.


 \begin{itemize}
 \item Case 1: \textbf{$k$ is even.} Then $\frac{kn(n+1)}{2}$ is always
 a multiple of $n$. Thus
 \[
 \lfloor\epsilon\rfloor+\lfloor2\epsilon\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor
 \]
 also has to be a multiple of $n$. We will prove that $\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor=0$
 for every positive integer $n$ by strong induction. The base case
 $n=1$ follows from the fact that $0\leqslant\epsilon<1$. Let us
 suppose that $\lfloor m\epsilon\rfloor=0$ for every $1\leqslant m<n$.
 Then the number
 \[
 \lfloor\epsilon\rfloor+\lfloor2\epsilon\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor=\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor
 \]
 has to be a multiple of $n$. As $0\leqslant\epsilon<1$ then $0\leqslant n\epsilon<n$,
 which means that the number $\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor$ has to be
 equal to 0. The equality $\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor=0$ implies $0\leqslant\epsilon<1/n$.
 Since this has to happen for all $n$, we conclude that $\epsilon=0$.
 Thus $\alpha$ is an even integer. Since $r > 0$, $\alpha = 2r > 0$. So $\alpha$ must be a positive even integer. This means $2r = 2m$ for some positive integer $m$. Therefore, $r=m$ must be a positive integer.
 \item Case 2: \textbf{$k$ is odd.} We will prove that $\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor=n-1$
 for every natural number $n$ by strong induction. The base case $n=1$
 again follows from the fact that $0\leqslant\epsilon<1$. Let us suppose
 that $\lfloor m\epsilon\rfloor=m-1$ for every $1\leqslant m<n$.
 We need the number
 \[
 \begin{aligned}\frac{kn(n+1)}{2}+\lfloor\epsilon\rfloor+\lfloor2\epsilon\rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor & =\frac{kn(n+1)}{2}+0+1+\cdots+(n-2)+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor

 & =\frac{kn(n+1)}{2}+\frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2}+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor

 & =\frac{k+1}{2}n^{2}+\frac{k-3}{2}n+1+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor
 \end{aligned}
 \]
 to be a multiple of $n$. As $k$ is odd, we need $1+\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor$
 to be a multiple of $n$. Again, as $0\leqslant\epsilon<1$ then $0\leqslant n\epsilon<n$,
 so $\lfloor n\epsilon\rfloor=n-1$ as we wanted. This implies that
 $1-\frac{1}{n}\leqslant\epsilon<1$ for all $n$. Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$, we get $\epsilon=1$, which contradicts $0 \le \epsilon < 1$.
 So there are no other solutions in this case.

 Let the limit of the sequence $(a_n)$ exist and be equal to $g$. Then, for sufficiently large $n$,

 Lemma. If the limit of $a_n$ as $n \to \infty$ exists and is equal to $g$, then $g$ divides $2 \gcd(x, y)$.

 Proof. For sufficiently large $n$, we have $a_n = \gcd \left( x^n +y , \, y^n +x \right) = g$.
 This implies that $g$ divides $x^n + y$ and $g$ divides $y^n +x$ for all $n \ge N$, for some positive integer $N$.

 Consider $n \ge N$. We have $x^n + y \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$ and $x^{n+1} + y \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$.
 Multiplying the first congruence by $x$, we get $x^{n+1} + xy \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$.
 Subtracting the second congruence from this, we have $(x^{n+1} + xy) - (x^{n+1} + y) \equiv 0 - 0 \pmod{g}$, which simplifies to $xy - y = y(x-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{g}$.

 Analogously, $x(y-1)$ is divisible by $g$.
 Their difference $x-y$ is then divisible by $g$, so $g$ also divides
 $x(y-1)+x(x-y)=x^2 -x$. All powers of $x$ are then congruent modulo
 $g$, so $x+y\equiv x^{N}+y\equiv0(\bmod g)$. Then $2x=(x+y)+(x-y)$
 and $2y=(x+y)-(x-y)$ are both divisible by $g$, so $g\mid2\operatorname{gcd}(x,y)$.
 On the other hand, it is clear that $\operatorname{gcd}(x,y)\mid g$,
 thus proving the Lemma.

 Let $d=\operatorname{gcd}(x,y)$, and write $x=da$ and $y=db$ for
 coprime positive integers $a$ and $b$. We have that

 \[
 \operatorname{gcd}\left((da)^{n}+db,(db)^{n}+da\right)=d\operatorname{gcd}\left(d^{n-1}a^{n}+b,d^{n-1}b^{n}+a\right)
 \]

 so the Lemma tells us that

 \[
 \operatorname{gcd}\left(d^{n-1}a^{n}+b,d^{n-1}b^{n}+a\right)\leqslant2
 \]

 for all $n\geqslant N$. Defining $K=d^{2}ab+1$, note that $K$ is
 coprime to each of $d,a$, and $b$. By Euler's theorem, for $n\equiv-1(\bmod\varphi(K))$
 we have that

 \[
 d^{n-1}a^{n}+b\equiv d^{-2}a^{-1}+b\equiv d^{-2}a^{-1}\left(1+d^{2}ab\right)\equiv 0\quad(\bmod K)
 \]

 so $K\mid d^{n-1}a^{n}+b$. Analogously, we have that $K\mid d^{n-1}b^{n}+a$.
 Taking such an $n$ which also satisfies $n\geqslant N$ gives us
 that

 \[
 K\mid\operatorname{gcd}\left(d^{n-1}a^{n}+b,d^{n-1}b^{n}+a\right)\leqslant2

 by the $i$-th girl. We want to show that at least one of the sequences
 $\{b_{n}\}_{n\ge M}$ or $\{g_{n}\}_{n\ge M}$ is periodic for some
 sufficiently large integer $M$.


 Let $M>\max\left(s_{1},\ldots,s_{2N}\right)$. We first prove that
 some integer appears infinitely many times. If not, then the sequence
 contains arbitrarily large integers. The first time each integer larger
 than $M$ appears, it is followed by a 1 . So 1 appears infinitely
 many times, which is a contradiction.


 Now we prove that every integer $x\geq M$ appears at most $M-1$
 times. If not, consider the first time that any $x\geq M$ appears
 for the $M^{\text{th }}$ time. Up to this point, each appearance
 of $x$ is preceded by an integer which has appeared $x\geq M$ times.
 So there must have been at least $M$ numbers that have already appeared
 at least $M$ times before $x$ does, which is a contradiction.


 Thus there are only finitely many numbers that appear infinitely many
 times. Let the largest of these be $k$. Since $k$ appears infinitely
 many times there must be infinitely many integers greater than $M$
 which appear at least $k$ times in the sequence, so each integer
 $1,2,\ldots,k-1$ also appears infinitely many times. Since $k+1$
 doesn't appear infinitely often there must only be finitely many numbers
 which appear more than $k$ times. Let the largest such number be
 $l\geq k$. From here on we call an integer $x$ big if $x>l$, medium
 if $l\geq x>k$ and small if $x\leq k$. To summarise, each small
 number appears infinitely many times in the sequence, while each big
 number appears at most $k$ times in the sequence.


 Choose a large enough $N^{\prime}>2N$ such that $s_{N^{\prime}}$
 is small, and in $s_{1},\ldots,s_{N^{\prime}}$ :
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item every medium number has already made all of its appearances;
 \item every small number has made more than $\max(k,N)$ appearances.
 \end{enumerate}
 Since every small number has appeared more than $k$ times, past this
 point each small number must be followed by a big number. Also, by
 definition each big number appears at most $k$ times, so it must
 be followed by a small number. Hence the sequence alternates between
 big and small numbers after $s_{N^{\prime}}$.


 \textbf{Lemma 1. }Let $g$ be a big number that appears after $s_{N^{\prime}}$.
 If $g$ is followed by the small number $h$, then $h$ equals the
 amount of small numbers which have appeared at least $g$ times before
 that point.


 \emph{Proof. }By the definition of $N^{\prime}$, the small number
 immediately preceding $g$ has appeared more than $\max(k,2N)$ times,
 so $g>\max(k,2N)$. And since $g>2N$, the $g^{\text{th }}$ appearance
 of every small number must occur after $s_{2N}$ and hence is followed
 by $g$. Since there are $k$ small numbers and $g$ appears at most
 $k$ times, $g$ must appear exactly $k$ times, always following
 a small number after $s_{2N}$. Hence on the $h^{\text{th }}$ appearance
 of $g$, exactly $h$ small numbers have appeared at least $g$ times
 before that point.

 (b) $s_{i}$ is small and $s_{i}=s_{j}$,

 Similarly, let $\mathcal{J}$ be the set of small numbers that appear

 $s_{i-2}\in\mathcal{I}$ and $s_{j-2}\in\mathcal{J}$.


 Suppose the small number $s_{j-2}$ is not in $\mathcal{I}$. This
 means $s_{j-2}$ has appeared less than $s_{i-1}$ times in $s_{[1,i-1]}$.
 By (c), $s_{j-2}$ has appeared at most $s_{i-1}$ times in $s_{[1,j-1]}$,
 hence $s_{j-1}\leq s_{i-1}$. Combining with $s_{[1,i-1]}\subset s_{[1,j-1]}$,
 this implies $\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mathcal{J}$. But since $s_{j-2}\in\mathcal{J}\backslash\mathcal{I}$,
 this contradicts $|\mathcal{I}|=|\mathcal{J}|$. So $s_{j-2}\in\mathcal{I}$,
 which means it has appeared at least $s_{i-1}$ times in $s_{[1,i-1]}$
 and one more time in $s_{[i,j-1]}$. Therefore $s_{j-1}>s_{i-1}$.


 By (c), any small number appearing at least $s_{j-1}$ times in $s_{[1,j-1]}$
 has also appeared $s_{j-1}-1\geq$ $s_{i-1}$ times in $s_{[1,i-1]}$.
 So $\mathcal{J}\subseteq\mathcal{I}$ and hence $\mathcal{I}=\mathcal{J}$.
 Therefore, $s_{i-2}\in\mathcal{J}$, so it must appear at least $s_{j-1}-s_{i-1}=1$
 more time in $s_{[i,j-1]}$.


 For each small number $s_{n}$ with $n>N^{\prime}+2$, let $p_{n}$
 be the smallest number such that $s_{n+p_{n}}=s_{i}$ is also small
 for some $i$ with $n\leq i<n+p_{n}$. In other words, $s_{n+p_{n}}=s_{i}$
 is the first small number to occur twice after $s_{n-1}$. If $i>n$,
 Lemma 2 (with $j=n+p_{n}$ ) implies that $s_{i-2}$ appears again
 before $s_{n+p_{n}}$, contradicting the minimality of $p_{n}$. So
 $i=n$. Lemma 2 also implies that $p_{n}\geq p_{n-2}$. So $p_{n},p_{n+2},p_{n+4},\ldots$
 is a nondecreasing sequence bounded above by $2k$ (as there are only
 $k$ small numbers). Therefore, $p_{n},p_{n+2},p_{n+4},\ldots$ is
 eventually constant and the subsequence of small numbers is eventually
 periodic with period at most $k$.","(Partial)

 \textbf{Claim. }Triangle $CB'Q$ is similar to $\triangle AIB$ (and
 $Q$ lies on circle $BIC$).


 \emph{Proof.} Since the tangent at $B'$ to the incircle, distinct
 from $BC$, is parallel to $AC$, and $B'I$ bisects the two tangents
 from $B'$,
 \[
 \angle CB'I=\frac{1}{2}\left(180^{\circ}-\angle ACB\right)=90^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2}\angle ACB.
 \]
 Using this, we get
 \[
 \angle CQB'=\angle CB'I-\angle BCK=90^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2}\angle ACB-\angle BAK=90^{\circ}-\frac{1}{2}(\angle ACB+\angle BAC)=\frac{1}{2}\angle CBA
 \]
 Which is enough to show $Q$ lies on circle $BIC$. Combining this
 with $\angle B'CQ=\angle BCK=$ $\angle BAI$ gives the similarity.

 Note that $K$ is the centre of circle $BIC$ so $K$ is the midpoint
 of $CQ$. Since $N$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $K$ and $N$ are similar
 points in the two triangles in the Claim so
 \[
 \angle KB'C'=\angle KB'C=\angle AIN.

 Similarly $\angle B'C'K=\angle MIA$ so

PB-Advanced-023,"On a table of size $3002\times3001$, a stone is placed on the leftmost cell of the first row. James and Peter play a game on this table. Peter selects $3000$ cells, under the rule that he must choose one from each row except the first and last rows (i.e., the $1$st and $3002$th row), and there must be at most one selected cell in each column. James knows this rule too, but he doesn't know which cells Peter selected. The goal of James is to move the stone to the last row, avoiding the cells selected by Peter. The stone can only move to adjacent cells on the table. If the stone enters a cell selected by Peter, James receives a penalty of 1 point, and the stone returns to its initial position (i.e., the leftmost cell). Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exists a method for James to achieve his goal before receiving a penalty of $n$ points.","First we demonstrate that there is no winning strategy if James has
 2 attempts.


 Suppose that $(2,i)$ is the first cell in the second row that James
 reaches on his first attempt. Peter could have selected this cell,
 in which case James receives a penalty and returns to the initial
 position, and he cannot have reached any other cells past the first
 row.


 Next, suppose that $(3,j)$ is the first cell in the third row that
 James reaches on his second attempt. James must have moved to this
 cell from $(2,j)$, so we know $j\neq i$. So it is possible that
 Peter selected the cell $(3,j)$, in which case James also receives
 a penalty and returns to the initial position on his second attempt.
 Therefore James cannot guarantee to reach the last row in 2 attempts.


 Next, we exhibit a strategy for $n=3$. On the first attempt, James
 travels along the path

 \[
 (1,1)\rightarrow(2,1)\rightarrow(2,2)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(2,3001).
 \]

 This path meets every cell in the second row, so James will find the
 selected cell in row 2, receive a penalty, and return to the initial
 position.


 If the selected cell in the second row is not on the edge of the board
 (that is, it is in cell $(2,i)$ with $2\leq i\leq3000$ ), then James
 takes the following two paths in his second and third attempts:

 \[
 \begin{aligned} & (1,1)\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow(1,i-1)\rightarrow(2,i-1)\rightarrow(3,i-1)\rightarrow(3,i)\rightarrow(4,i)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(3002,i).

  & (1,1)\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow(1,i+1)\rightarrow(2,i+1)\rightarrow(3,i+1)\rightarrow(3,i)\rightarrow(4,i)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(3002,i).
 \end{aligned}
 \]

 The only cells that Peter might have selected in either of these paths
 are $(3,i-1)$ and $(3,i+1)$. At most one of these can have been
 selected by Peter, so at least one of the two paths will be successful.
 James starts each path from the initial position $(1,1)$, but he
 knows where the selected cell in row 2 is, so he can navigate to $(1,i-1)$
 or $(1,i+1)$ directly.


 If the selected cell in the second row is on the edge of the board,
 without loss of generality we may assume it is in $(2,1)$. Then,
 on the second attempt, James takes the following path:

 \[
 (1,1)\rightarrow(1,2)\rightarrow(2,2)\rightarrow(2,3)\rightarrow(3,3)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(3000,3001)\rightarrow(3001,3001)\rightarrow(3002,3001).
 \]

 If none of the cells on this path were selected by Peter, then James
 wins. Otherwise, let $(i,j)$ be the first cell on which James encounters
 a selected cell. We have that $j=i$ or $j=i+1$. Then, on the third
 attempt, James takes the following path:

 \[
 \begin{aligned}(1,1)\rightarrow\dots\rightarrow(1,2) & \rightarrow(2,2)\rightarrow(2,3)\rightarrow(3,3)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(i-2,i-1)\rightarrow(i-1,i-1)

  & \rightarrow(i,i-1)\rightarrow(i,i-2)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(i,2)\rightarrow(i,1)

  & \rightarrow(i+1,1)\rightarrow\cdots\rightarrow(3001,1)\rightarrow(3002,1).
 \end{aligned}
 \]

 Now note that:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The cells from $(1,2)$ to $(i-1,i-1)$ were not selected because
 they were reached earlier than $(i,j)$ on the previous attempt.
 \item The cells $(i,k)$ for $1\leq k\leq i-1$ were not selected because
 there is only one selected cell in row $i$, and it lies in $(i,i)$
 or $(i,i+1)$.
 \item The cells $(k,1)$ for $i\leq k\leq3002$ were not selected because
 Peter selected at most one cell in column 1 (since there is one selected
 cell per row from 2 to 3001), and it lies in $(2,1)$.
 \end{itemize}
 Therefore James will win on the third attempt. Therefore, the smallest
 positive integer $n$ is $3$.","(Partial)

 this into $(*)$, we get
 \[
 (P(y)+a-P(y+P(a)))(P(a+P(y))-(y+P(a)))=0.
 \]
 This must hold for all $a\in\mathbb{Q}$ and all $y$ in the image
 of $b\mapsto b-P(a)$. Since $b$ can be any rational number, $y$
 can be any rational number (assuming $P(a)\in\mathbb{Q}$). Thus,
 for all $a,y\in\mathbb{Q}$, we have
 \[
 P(y+P(a))=P(y)+a\quad\text{or}\quad P(a+P(y))=y+P(a).
 \]
 Let's rewrite this by swapping variable names $a\to y$ and $y\to x$:
 For all $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$,
 \[
 P(x+P(y))=P(x)+y\quad\text{or}\quad P(P(x)+y)=x+P(y).\quad(**)
 \]
 We want to find the maximum possible number of elements in the set
 $S=\{P(a)+P(-a):a\in\mathbb{Q}\}$. Let $g(a)=P(a)+P(-a)$. We want
 to find the maximum possible size of the image of $g$.


 We begin by providing an example of a function $P$ for which there
 are two values of $g(a)$. We take the function $P(x)=2\lfloor x\rfloor-x=\lfloor x\rfloor-\{x\}$.
 First, we show that $P$ satisfies $(**)$. Given $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$,
 writing $f$ instead of $P$: If $\{x\}<\{y\}$, then $f(f(x)+y)=x+f(y)$.
 This is the second case of $(**)$. If $\{x\}>\{y\}$, then $f(x+f(y))=f(x)+y$.
 This is the first case of $(**)$. If $\{x\}=\{y\}$, then $f(x)+y=x+f(y)=N$
 (an integer). $f(N)=N$. So $f(x+f(y))=f(N)=N=f(x)+y$ and $f(f(x)+y)=f(N)=N=x+f(y)$.
 Both cases of $(**)$ hold. In all cases, the relation $(**)$ is
 satisfied, which is equivalent to the original condition $(*)$.


 Finally, we compute $g(a)=P(a)+P(-a)$ for this function. $g(a)=(2\lfloor a\rfloor-a)+(2\lfloor-a\rfloor-(-a))=2(\lfloor a\rfloor+\lfloor-a\rfloor)$.
 If $a$ is an integer, $\lfloor a\rfloor=a$ and $\lfloor-a\rfloor=-a$,
 so $g(a)=2(a-a)=0$. If $a$ is not an integer, $\lfloor-a\rfloor=-\lfloor a\rfloor-1$,
 so $g(a)=2(\lfloor a\rfloor-\lfloor a\rfloor-1)=-2$. The set of values
 for $g(a)$ is $\{0,-2\}$. There are two values for $g(a)$.

 Now, we prove that there cannot be more than two values of $g(a).$
 Applying $(**)$ with $y=x$ tells us that $P(x+P(x))=P(x)+x$ or
 $P(P(x)+x)=x+P(x)$. In either case, if we let $z=x+P(x)$, then $P(z)=z$.
 So
 \[
 P(x+P(x))=x+P(x)\qquad\tag{(1)}
 \]
 for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$.


 We begin with the following lemma.


 \textbf{Lemma 1.} $P$ is a bijection, and satisfies
 \[
 P(-P(-x))=x\qquad\tag{(2)}
 \]

 \emph{Proof.} We first prove that $P$ is injective. Suppose that
 $P(x_{1})=P(x_{2})=Y$. The condition $(**)$ applied to $(x_{1},x_{2})$
 gives $P(x_{1}+P(x_{2}))=P(x_{1})+x_{2}$ or $P(P(x_{1})+x_{2})=x_{1}+P(x_{2})$.
 Substituting $P(x_{1})=P(x_{2})=Y$, this becomes $P(x_{1}+Y)=Y+x_{2}$
 or $P(Y+x_{2})=x_{1}+Y$.

 From (1), we know $P(x_{1}+P(x_{1}))=x_{1}+P(x_{1})$, i.e., $P(x_{1}+Y)=x_{1}+Y$.
 Also from (1), $P(x_{2}+P(x_{2}))=x_{2}+P(x_{2})$, i.e., $P(x_{2}+Y)=x_{2}+Y$.

 Case A: $P(x_{1}+Y)=Y+x_{2}$ holds. Using $P(x_{1}+Y)=x_{1}+Y$,
 we get $x_{1}+Y=Y+x_{2}$, which implies $x_{1}=x_{2}$.

 Case B: $P(Y+x_{2})=x_{1}+Y$ holds. Using $P(x_{2}+Y)=x_{2}+Y$,
 we get $x_{2}+Y=x_{1}+Y$, which implies $x_{1}=x_{2}$.

 In both cases, $x_{1}=x_{2}$. So $P$ is injective.


 Now, (1) with $x=0$ tells us that $P(0+P(0))=0+P(0)$, so $P(P(0))=P(0)$.
 By injectivity, $P(0)=0$.

 Let $C(x,y)$: $P(x+P(y))=P(x)+y$ or $P(P(x)+y)=x+P(y)$.

 $C(x,-P(x))$: $P(x+P(-P(x)))=P(x)-P(x)=0$ or $P(P(x)-P(x))=x+P(-P(x))$.

 Case 1: $P(x+P(-P(x)))=0$. Since $P(0)=0$ and $P$ is injective,
 $x+P(-P(x))=0$, so $P(-P(x))=-x$.

 Case 2: $P(0)=x+P(-P(x))$. Since $P(0)=0$, this gives $0=x+P(-P(x))$,
 so $P(-P(x))=-x$.

 Both options yield $P(-P(x))=-x$. Replace $x$ with $-x$: $P(-P(-x))=-(-x)=x$.
 This proves (2).


 Finally, bijectivity follows immediately from (2). $P$ is injective.
 For any $y\in\mathbb{Q}$, let $x=-P(-y)$. Then $P(x)=P(-P(-y))=y$.
 So $P$ is surjective.


 Since $P$ is bijective, it has an inverse, which we denote $P^{-1}$.
 From (2), $P(-P(-x))=x$. Let $z=-P(-x)$. Then $P(z)=x$, so $z=P^{-1}(x)$.
 Thus, $P^{-1}(x)=-P(-x)$. Rearranging gives $P(-x)=-P^{-1}(x)$.
 We have $g(x)=P(x)+P(-x)=P(x)-P^{-1}(x)$.

 Suppose $g(x)=u$ and $g(y)=v$, where $u\neq v$ are both nonzero.
 Define $x^{\prime}=P^{-1}(x)$ and $y^{\prime}=P^{-1}(y)$. By definition,
 $P(x')=x$ and $P(y')=y$. We have $g(x)=P(x)-P^{-1}(x)=P(x)-x'=u$,
 so $P(x)=x'+u$. Similarly,
 \[
 g(y)=P(y)-P^{-1}(y)=P(y)-y'=v,
 \]
 so $P(y)=y'+v$.


 Apply $(**)$ to $(x',y)$:

 \[
 P(x'+P(y))=P(x')+y\text{ or }P(P(x')+y)=x'+P(y).
 \]
 $P(x'+y'+v)=x+y$ or $P(x+y)=x'+y'+v$. (Let $A=x+y,B=x'+y'+v$. $P(B)=A$
 or $P(A)=B$.)



  Apply $(**)$ to $(x,y')$:
 \[
 P(x+P(y'))=P(x)+y'\text{ or }P(P(x)+y')=x+P(y').
 \]
 $P(x+y)=P(x)+y'=(x'+u)+y'$ or $P(x'+u+y')=x+y$. (Let $C=x'+y'+u$.
 $P(A)=C$ or $P(C)=A$.)


 We have the possibilities:

 (1a) $P(B)=A$ and (2a) $P(A)=C$.

 (1a) $P(B)=A$ and (2b) $P(C)=A$. Since $P$ is injective, $B=C$,
 so $x'+y'+v=x'+y'+u$, which implies $u=v$. Contradiction.

 (1b) $P(A)=B$ and (2a) $P(A)=C$. Since $P(A)$ must be unique, $B=C$,
 which implies $u=v$. Contradiction.

 (1b) $P(A)=B$ and (2b) $P(C)=A$.

 So we must have either ($P(B)=A$ and $P(A)=C$) or ($P(A)=B$ and
 $P(C)=A$).


 Case 1: $P(x'+y'+v)=x+y$ and $P(x+y)=x'+y'+u$.

 Case 2: $P(x+y)=x'+y'+v$ and $P(x'+y'+u)=x+y$.


 Swapping $(x,u)$ with $(y,v)$ transforms Case 1 into Case 2 structure
 and vice versa. So, without loss of generality, assume Case 2 holds:
 $P(x+y)=x'+y'+v$ and $P(x'+y'+u)=x+y$.


 Now consider $(**)$ applied to $(x+y,-x'-u)$. Let $A=x+y$ and $Z=-x'-u$.
 Using $P(-z)=-P^{-1}(z)$, we have $P(-x'-u)=-P^{-1}(x'+u)$. From
 $P(x)=x'+u$ we have $x=P^{-1}(x'+u)$. Therefore, $P(Z)=P(-x'-u)=-x$.

 Now $C(A,Z)$ gives: $P(A+P(Z))=P(A)+Z$ or $P(P(A)+Z)=A+P(Z)$. Substitute
 $A=x+y$, $Z=-x'-u$, $P(Z)=-x$. And $P(A)=P(x+y)=x'+y'+v$ (using
 Case 2).


 Option 1: $P((x+y)+(-x))=P(x+y)+(-x'-u)$. $P(y)=(x'+y'+v)-x'-u=y'+v-u$.

 Option 2: $P(P(x+y)+Z)=A+P(Z)$. $P((x'+y'+v)+(-x'-u))=(x+y)+(-x)$.
 $P(y'+v-u)=y$.


 So we have $P(y)=y'+v-u$ or $P(y'+v-u)=y$. This means $y'+v-u$
 must be either $P(y)$ or $P^{-1}(y)$. We know $P(y)=y'+v$ and $P^{-1}(y)=y'$.
 If $y'+v-u=P(y)=y'+v$, then $v-u=v$, which means $u=0$. This contradicts
 our assumption $u\neq0$. If $y'+v-u=P^{-1}(y)=y'$, then $v-u=0$,
 which means $u=v$. This contradicts our assumption $u\neq v$.


 Both possibilities lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the initial
 assumption that there exist distinct non-zero values $u,v$ for $g(x)$
 must be false. The set $S=\{g(a):a\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ can contain $g(0)=P(0)+P(0)=0$.
 It can contain at most one non-zero value $u$. Thus, the set $S$
 must be a subset of $\{0,u\}$ for some $u\in\mathbb{Q}$. The maximum
 possible number of elements in $S$ is $2$.


 Since we found an example where the set of values is $\{0,-2\}$,
 which has 2 elements, the maximum possible number of elements is exactly

PB-Advanced-025,"Let $k$ and $d$ be positive integers. Prove that there exists a
 positive integer $N$ such that for every odd integer $n>N$, the
 digits in the base-$2n$ representation of $n^{k}$ are all greater
 than $d$.","The problem actually doesn't have much to do with digits: the idea
 is to pick any length $\ell\leq k$, and look at the rightmost $\ell$
 digits of $n^{k}$; that is, the remainder upon division by $(2n)^{\ell}$.
 We compute it exactly:

 Claim - Let $n\geq1$ be an odd integer, and $k\geq\ell\geq1$ integers.
 Then

 \[
 n^{k}\bmod(2n)^{l}=c(k,\ell)\cdot n^{l}
 \]

 for some odd integer $1\leq c(k,\ell)\leq2^{\ell}-1$.

 Proof. This follows directly by the Chinese remainder theorem, with
 $c(k,\ell)$ being the residue class of $n^{k-i}\left(\bmod2^{\ell}\right)$
 since $n$ is odd. In particular, for the $\ell$ th digit from the
 right to be greater than $d$, it would be enough that
 \[
 c(k,\ell)\cdot n^{\ell}\geq(d+1)\cdot(2n)^{\ell-1}
 \]
 But this inequality holds whenever $n\geq(d+1)\cdot2^{\ell-1}$.

 Putting this together by varying $\ell$, we find that for all odd

 \[
 n\geq(d+1)\cdot2^{k-1}
 \]

 we have that
 \begin{itemize}
 \item $n^{k}$ has $k$ digits in base- $2n$; and
 \item for each $\ell=1,\ldots,k$, the $\ell^{\text{th }}$ digit from the
 right is at least $d+1$

  so the problem is solved.

 Q(x)=x^{n-2}+b_{n-3}x^{n-3}+\cdots+b_{0}.
 \]

 (And let $b_{n-2}=1$. ) Then the fact that the $x^{k}$ coefficient
 of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are both zero means

 \[
 r_{1}b_{k}+b_{k-1}=r_{2}b_{k}+b_{k-1}=0
 \]

 and hence that $b_{k}=b_{k-1}=0$ (since the $r_{i}$ are distinct).



  To solve the problem, it suffices to prove:


 \textbf{Claim 2.} If $F(x)\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ is a polynomial with
 two consecutive zero coefficients, it cannot have all distinct real
 roots.

 both zero. Assume for contradiction all the roots of $F$ are real
 and distinct. Then by Rolle's theorem, every higher-order derivative
 of $F$ should have this property too. However, the $t$th order derivative
 of $F$ has a double root of $0$, contradiction.","(Partial)

PB-Advanced-027,"Alice the architect and Bob the builder play a game. First, Alice
 chooses two points $P$ and $Q$ in the plane and a subset $S$ of
 the plane, which are announced to Bob. Next, Bob marks infinitely
 many points in the plane, designating each a city. He may not place
 two cities within distance at most one unit of each other, and no
 three cities he places may be collinear. Finally, roads are constructed
 between the cities as follows: for each pair $A,B$ of cities, they
 are connected with a road along the line segment $AB$ if and only
 if the following condition holds: For every city $C$ distinct from
 $A$ and $B$, there exists $R\in S$ such that $\triangle PQR$ is
 directly similar to either $\triangle ABC$ or $\triangle BAC$. Alice
 wins the game if

 \noindent (i) the resulting roads allow for travel between any pair
 of cities via a finite sequence of roads and

 \noindent (ii) no two roads cross.

 \noindent Otherwise, Bob wins. Determine, with proof, which player
 has a winning strategy. (Note: $\triangle UVW$ is directly similar
 to $\triangle XYZ$ if there exists a sequence of rotations, translations,
 and dilations sending $U$ to $X$, $V$ to $Y$, and $W$ to $Z$.)","The answer is that Alice wins. Let's define a Bob-set $V$ to be
 a set of points in the plane with no three collinear and with all
 distances at least 1 . The point of the problem is to prove the following
 fact.

 Claim - Given a Bob-set $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2}$, consider the
 Bob-graph with vertex set $V$ defined as follows: draw edge $ab$
 if and only if the disk with diameter $\overline{ab}$ contains no
 other points of $V$ on or inside it. Then the Bob-graph is connected
 and planar.

 Proving this claim shows that Alice wins since Alice can specify $\mathcal{S}$
 to be the set of points outside the disk of diameter $PQ$.

 We start with proving that every Bob-graph is connected. Assume for
 contradiction the graph is disconnected. Let $p$ and $q$ be two
 points in different connected components. Since $pq$ is not an edge,
 there exists a third point $r$ inside the disk with diameter $\overline{pq}$.

 Hence, $r$ is in a different connected component from at least one
 of $p$ or $q$ - let's say point $p$. Then we repeat the same argument
 on the disk with diameter $\overline{pr}$ to find a new point $s$,
 non-adjacent to either $p$ or $r$. See the figure below, where the
 X'ed out dashed edges indicate points which are not only non-adjacent
 but in different connected components.

 In this way we generate an infinite sequence of distances $\delta_{1},\delta_{2},\delta_{3},\ldots$
 among the non-edges in the picture above. By the ""Pythagorean theorem""
 (or really the inequality for it), we have

 \[
 \delta_{i}^{2}\leq\delta_{i-1}^{2}-1
 \]

 and this eventually generates a contradiction for large $i$, since
 we get $0\leq\delta_{i}^{2}\leq\delta_{1}^{2}-(i-$ $1)$.

 Now we prove that every Bob-graph is planar. Assume for contradiction
 that edges $ac$ and $bd$ meet, meaning $abcd$ is a convex quadrilateral.
 WLOG assume $\angle bad\geq90^{\circ}$ (each quadrilateral has an
 angle at least $90^{\circ}$ ). Then the disk with diameter $\overline{bd}$
 contains $a$, contradiction.","(Partial)

 \[
 \frac{1}{n+1}\sum_{i=0}^{n}\binom{n}{i}^{k}

 is an integer for every positive integer $n$.","The answer is all even $k$. Let's abbreviate $S(n):=\binom{n}{0}^{k}+\cdots+\binom{n}{n}^{k}$
 for the sum in the problem.


 \textbf{Proof that even $k$ is necessary.}

  Choose $n=2$. We need $3\mid S(2)=2+2^{k}$, which requires $k$
 to be even.


 \textbf{Proof that even $k$ is sufficient. }

 From now on we treat $k$ as fixed, and we let $p^{e}$ be a prime
 fully dividing $n+1$. It is sufficient to prove that $S(n)$ is a
 multiple of $p^{e}$ for each such $p^{e}$. The basic idea is to
 reduce from $n+1$ to $(n+1)/p$ by an induction. We prove the following
 lemma on each individual binomial coefficient.


 \textbf{Lemma. }Suppose $p^{e}$ is a prime power which fully divides
 $n+1$. Then

 \[
 \binom{n}{i}\equiv\pm\binom{\frac{n+1}{p}-1}{\lfloor i/p\rfloor}\quad\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)
 \]

 \emph{Proof.} If we write
 \[
 \binom{n}{i}=\prod_{1\leq j\leq i}\frac{n-(j-1)}{j}
 \]

 then the fractions for $p\nmid j$ are all $\pm1\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)$.
 So only considers those $j$ with $p\mid j$; in that case one obtains
 the claimed $\binom{\frac{n+1}{p}-1}{\lfloor i/p\rfloor}$ exactly
 (even without having to take modulo $p^{e}$).


 From the lemma, it follows if $p^{e}$ is a prime power which fully
 divides $n+1$, then
 \[
 S(n)\equiv p\cdot S\left(\frac{n+1}{p}-1\right)\quad\left(\bmod p^{e}\right)
 \]

 by grouping the $n+1$ terms (for $0\leq i\leq n$ ) into consecutive
 ranges of length $p$ (by the value of $\lfloor i/p\rfloor$ ) and
 the result follows by induction.","(Partial)

PB-Advanced-030,"Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers with $m\ge n$. There are
 $m$ cupcakes of different flavors arranged around a circle and $n$
 people who like cupcakes. Each person assigns a non-negative real
 number score to each cupcake, depending on how much they like the
 cupcake. Suppose that for each person $P$, it is possible to partition
 the circle of $m$ cupcakes into $n$ groups of consecutive cupcakes
 so that the sum of $P$'s scores of the cupcakes in each group is
 at least $1$. Prove that it is possible to distribute the $m$ cupcakes
 to the $n$ people so that each person $P$ receives cupcakes of total
 score at least $1$ with respect to $P$.","Arbitrarily pick any one person - call her Pip - and her $n$ arcs.
 The initial idea is to try to apply Hall's marriage lemma to match
 the $n$ people with Pip's arcs (such that each such person is happy
 with their matched arc). To that end, construct the obvious bipartite
 graph $\mathfrak{G}$ between the people and the arcs for Pip.

 We now consider the following algorithm, which takes several steps.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item If a perfect matching of $\mathfrak{G}$ exists, we're done!
 \item We're probably not that lucky. Per Hall's condition, this means there
 is a bad set $\mathcal{B}_{1}$ of people, who are compatible with
 fewer than $\left|\mathcal{B}_{1}\right|$ of the arcs. Then delete
 $\mathcal{B}_{1}$ and the neighbors of $\mathcal{B}_{1}$, then try
 to find a matching on the remaining graph.
 \item If a matching exists now, terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, that
 means there's another bad set $\mathcal{B}_{2}$ for the remaining
 graph. We again delete $\mathcal{B}_{2}$ and the fewer than $\mathcal{B}_{2}$
 neighbors.
 \item Repeat until some perfect matching $\mathcal{M}$ is possible in the
 remaining graph, i.e. there are no more bad sets (and then terminate
 once that occurs).
 \end{itemize}
 Since Pip is a universal vertex, it's impossible to delete Pip, so
 the algorithm does indeed terminate with nonempty $\mathcal{M}$.

 We commit to assigning each of person in $\mathcal{M}$ their matched
 arc (in particular if there are no bad sets at all, the problem is
 already solved). Now we finish the problem by induction on $n$ (for
 the remaining people) by simply deleting the arcs used up by $\mathcal{M}$.

 To see why this deletion-induction works, consider any particular
 person Quinn not in $\mathcal{M}$. By definition, Quinn is not happy
 with any of the $\operatorname{arcs}$ in $\mathcal{M}$. So when
 an $\operatorname{arc}\mathcal{A}$ of $\mathcal{M}$ is deleted,
 it had value less than 1 for Quinn so in particular it couldn't contain
 entirely any of Quinn's arcs. Hence at most one endpoint among Quinn's
 arcs was in the deleted $\operatorname{arc}\mathcal{A}$. When this
 happens, this causes two arcs of Quinn to merge, and the merged value
 is

 \[
 (\geq1)+(\geq1)-(\leq1)\quad\geq1
 \]

 meaning the induction is OK.","(Partial)
